This past weekend, my family made so much food that there was still plenty of it going into the week .  Knowing this, we chose not to make any new food, because we could still eat the leftover food from the weekend .  All we would need to do was warm it up on the stove top .  The stove is a gas stove, which produces a flame that, in my opinion, cooks food much better than an electric stove .  On Monday after getting home from work, rather than making a new meal, my mom took some of the leftover food that we had saved from the weekend and put some of the food into a pan, and put a pan on The stove .  My mom turned the gas on until the burner ignited, and left the heat on until my mom felt that the leftover food was warm enough .  When my mom ate the heat, my mom swore the heat was as good as the heat was when the heat was freshly made . Washing dishes is a major work done in houses, restaurant and all eatable place. First take cleaning liquid in a bowl. On account of the dishes to be cleaned take enough liquid. First pour some water on the dishes so that food particles etc., will run off. Then take each and every dish clean with spongy filled with cleaning liquid. Wash the dish till cleaning liquid goes. Wipe the dishes for dry with a dry cloth. Arrange all the dishes in the stand or preferred place 

Were they heating leftovers

Yes they were reheating leftovers.
No,it was fresh.

I was at camp and getting ready to lead a workshop teaching cooking on a campfire .  Luckily it had not rained for a few days so all the wood in the area was dry .  I had some large logs that were sitting by the fire ring so I went searching for some smaller sticks and kindling .  I built a log cabin structure out of the larger logs .  Inside a log cabin structure I put some very small tinder as well as some balled up pieces of the newspaper .  I lit the newspaper and continued adding very small pieces of wood to the newspaper .  When very small pieces of wood started catching I started adding larger twigs .  As smaller pieces started catching on fire I kept added larger and larger twigs and sticks until the larger logs started burning .  I continued to add sticks so I could get a nice sized fire burning that would create lots of hot coals so we could cook on lots of hot coals . Gather sticks Buy some logs from a store Line an area with stones Put logs on bottom Stack sticks on top Put some paper in the sticks light paper on fire Add more sticks and logs as fire burns down When finished, pour bucket of water on fire to extinguish 

What did they use to make the bonfire

First I go to the store and buy bread .  For the freshest bread, I get a whole loaf and bring a whole loaf home to slice a whole loaf there .  I use a bread knife which makes cutting a whole loaf easier, and cut off just what I need for the toast, leaving the rest whole .  I wrap and store the remaining loaf for next time .  Then I get the toaster out of the cabinet and place the toaster out of the cabinet on the counter, then plug the toaster out of the cabinet in .  I choose the darkness of the freshest bread - not too dark, somewhere in the middle for flavor and safety - then indicate the slice thickness using the knob on the toaster out .  I place the first two slices of bread in the slots and press down on the big button, which causes the bread to drop in and the toaster to get very hot .  The timer counts down and I pay attention to The timer carefully, making sure the toast pops up and the toaster out turns off .  I unplug The timer immediately but let The timer cool down before putting The timer away as The timer is very hot .  I butter the freshest bread using a knife and then put away the knives and butter . put the bread in the toaster . adjust the knob for light medium or dark . when the toast pops up pull it out .

I miss I best friend Shelly's and so I decided to send Shelly's a letter telling Shelly's all about I trip to my sister's house in Alaska, and to also tell Shelly's that I hoped Shelly's was well .  I finished writing a letter telling her all about my trip to my sister's house in Alaska and as I went to find a stamp and an envelope I needed to send a stamp, I had found that I did not have any .  I went to a store that sells cards and envelopes, and chose a box of pretty purple-colored envelopes to mail a letter telling her all about my trip to my sister's house in Alaska in .  After that I went to the post office to purchase some stamps that are like small stickers, and chose the heart design on it that I liked .  I only needed one to send a letter telling her all about my trip to my sister's house in Alaska but I bought more so that I could send another letter soon if I wanted to .  When I got home I filled out the envelope with Shelly's name and address in the middle, and wrote my sister's address in the top left corner of the envelope .  I stuck a stamp with the heart design on it in the top left corner of the envelope .  Now a stamp was ready to be put in the mail and she will receive a stamp in about one week .  I drove to the post office and put a letter telling her all about my trip to my sister's house in Alaska in the outgoing mail slot .  Shelly's will be so surprised . go to where you are supposed to watch for them . look in direction where the kids will be coming from . wait specified length of time until they arrive .

The previous night and this morning before work I noticed I was missing a lot of necessary ingredients for I future meals .  I planned out a trip to the grocery store immediately after work .  After I finished working I drove over to the store .  It was very crowded but not too hard to find a parking spot .  Once inside the store, I grabbed the nearest shopping cart and smiled as one of the grocery workers welcomed I in .  Once inside and out of everyone's way, I thought about what I needed .  Since I did n't have the list in my head, it took I a few minutes .  Once I came up with the list in my head, I started to map out a route in my head that would take the least amount of time for I to follow in the store .  First, I picked up I deli .  They offered I some free samples of the meat I asked for .  Then I picked up I bread which was right nearby .  At the back wall of the store I found the meat I was going to cook tonight .  After the meat I was going to cook tonight, I grabbed a few extra items that I thought might also be nice later this week while heading towards checkout .  Luckily, there was n't a line and this was done quickly .  I paid with I debit card and left with all my groceries in a cart, packed all my groceries into I car, and headed home . invite friends to come over decide the meat you want to cook make sure you have supplies like food and drink fire up the barbecue when friends arrive put meat on BBQ cook meat serve meat visit with friends.

I like to stay in touch with I family and friends .  Usually when we are busy we stay in touch by texting but we like to hear each others voices so we often call each other .  I friends and brother like to use our cell phones .  I give our cell phones all a special ring tone so I know who all a special ring tone is right away when our cell phones call .  I take I phone out of I pocket and look at the face and see I brother or friends picture .  Then I swipe the green phone icon and hold the green phone icon to I ear and say ``Hi There .  '' But sometimes I still use land lines, like when I am at work or I grandparents house .  Then I will hear the classic ring of an old phone, and I will have to go over to the phone to pick the classic ring of an old phone up .  I take the receiver off the cradle the receiver sitting on and hold the receiver to I ear and say ``Hello .  '' The person on the other end will have to introduce The person on the other end, because I wont know who has called .  But usually I am lucky and the receiver someone I want to talk to, so the receiver a fun surprise . do everything the other persondoes .

Last night after dinner, I had "dishwasher duty . " That means that it was my turn to do the dishes and unload the dishwasher .  After the dishwasher had washed the dishes, I first opened the door to the dishwasher .  I unloaded the bottom rack first .  That way, if any water drips or leftover food were stuck on the dishes still, they wouldn't trickle down to my clean dishes .  The bottom drawer usually has my plates in it .  After unloading the bottom drawer, I unloaded the top drawer, which usually contains my cups, utensils, and my bowls .  I use a towel to dry off any leftover water drips .  I then put all of the dishes back into the original cupboard places that they came from .  That means that I put my plates in the cupboard near my sink, and I put my cups in the cupboard near my fridge .  Lastly, I put my utensils and bowls in a cupboard near the microwave . open the dishwasher . take out the dishes and put them in the correct cupboards . when all of the dishes have been put away close the dishwasher .

Yesterday I made a flight reservation to fly from Boston to Chicago .  The first step in making a flight reservation is to determine which airline you would like to fly .  I picked American Airlines because I have most of I airline miles with American Airlines and I always like to earn more miles .  I accessed the American Airlines website and entered the desired dates of I flight .  The American Airlines website then provided I a bunch of different flight options for both I departing and returning flights .  I selected the flights that worked the best for me and were the most affordable and I selected the flights that worked the best for me and were the most affordable .  I was then directed to pay for I flight which I did via I American Airlines credit card .  Once I flight was paid for I received an email confirming I transaction and providing I I flight details .  I find that using the internet is much easier than calling the airlines for a flight reservation . call travel agent . inquire about flight on desired dates . if price acceptable make reservation .

After a four hour drive We arrived at the campgrounds .  We found We spot and unpacked the car .  First up was pitching the tent, then We set about making a fire to cook dinner .  The tent took awhile to collect all the wood We needed and get the tent roaring, but once We got the food on a fire to cook dinner We could finally relax .  After soaking in nature and enjoying We campfire meal, night had fallen and our campfire meal was time for bed .  We curled up in We sleeping bags and told scary stories until We drifted off .  The next morning We awoke early to stoke a fire to cook dinner and get breakfast started .  A day of hiking and fishing went by far too fast and after another night under the stars We packed up We gear and headed home . Gather wood. Find safe place away from buildings. Pile wood into pyre.

Mom brought sun tan lotion to protect we from the sun .  Once we got to the beach mom and dad setup all off beach chairs, umbrella and towels .  Mom laid down on a towel while Dad went running to the ocean .  We swam but not too far because the water was very deep .  There were a lot of waves and some people there were surfing with surfboards .  There was other people that were playing volleyball on the beach and there were a lot of kids building sand castles .  Dad helped we build we sand castle with a pool so that when the waves came in a pool would fill in we pool .  At the beach there was also a tower for the lifeguards to see everyone in the water .  There was a guy who went out too far into the water that the lifeguards had to blow the lifeguards whistle for the guy to come closer to the beach .  The lifeguards have heard that sometimes you can see shark in the ocean but lucky for we we did not see any sharks .  Visiting the beach was very fun for the whole family as Mom can relax and get a tan and dad could play and swim with we . ask 'can i help you carry that?' . if they say yes then . grasp one end of the object . move the object to the desired location .

Yesterday I hosted a barbecue for about twenty people .  A barbecue was a really fun event and I enjoyed having my friends over to I beach house .  To prepare for a barbecue I went shopping at the grocery store for hamburgers, hotdogs, rolls, chips, salad and soda .  When I returned from the grocery store I prepared the salads and laid all of the food out to be cooked on the grill .  As my friends began to arrive one of my friends volunteered to cook all of the food while the rest of us socialized and played volley ball .  As the food was prepared us all enjoyed eating a burger or hot dog and then us quickly returned to playing different lawn games such as croquet and horseshoes .  After a few hours my friends decided that the food was time to go home .  Us really had a fun afternoon and I am excited to host a few more barbecues this summer .

In the morning I felt hungry and decided to make I some scrambled eggs for breakfast .  I took out a carton of eggs from the refrigerator and placed a carton of eggs from the refrigerator on the counter .  From a carton of eggs from the refrigerator, I took three eggs and inspected three eggs for cracks .  Three eggs looked fine, so I cracked three eggs into a small bowl being careful to to have any shells in a small bowl .  I added a splash of water and then began to scramble three eggs with a whisk .  Next I heated up a frying pan with a little butter in a frying pan .  Once a frying pan was hot, I poured three eggs in a frying pan .  After adding a dash of salt and pepper, I kept scrambling three eggs .  Occasionally i would remove a frying pan from heat while scrambling for a short moment .  Once three eggs looks firm and ready, I turned off the stove and plated three eggs to enjoy .  I added a small sprig of parsley to the plate to make a small sprig of parsley look even fancier . crack eggs into mixing bowl whisk eggs add any seasoning you may want turn stove to low/medium heat place pan on stove poor whisked eggs into pan as the eggs cook, stir them with spatula once eggs are no longer liquified, remove from pan 

Why did the eggs cook

The heat made them cook.
The counter heated them up.

Tennis is an outdoor sport game played usually with both people playing the game, sometimes there are two people on each team called pairs .  There is a low net between both people playing the game .  We use tennis rackets and tennis balls to hit the ball out back and forth to each other .  Sometimes the other person can hit the ball out of bounds of the other person and that makes them miss the ball out so that person scores .  The other person wins the set .

Sometimes for dinner I like to have the fish .  When I want to have fish for dinner I will go to I local fish market and pick out something I like .  Some times it might be salmon, sometimes tuna, or maybe a white fish like tilapia or flounder .  I will buy a pound of it, and the fish monger will wrap it in wax paper and put it in a bag for I .  Once I have it home, I check it, finding it clean and not smelling at all like fish .  I will put it in a glass casserole dish and season it with salt, pepper, garlic, lemon, vinegar and olive oil .  I might put a few onions in with olive oil .  I will turn on the oven and while the oven gets hot I will make a salad .  Once the oven is hot I will put the fish inside and set a timer .  While the fish bakes, I will make other side dishes .  When the timer rings I know its done and I carefully take its out with oven mitts .  Its smells so good of garlic and its nice and cooked through .  While I set the table, I let its cool and after a few minutes I serve I self a piece and I salad and side dishes . Sending food back (in a restaurant) may occur when your waiter serves wrong food. First you see that the food served to you is ordered by you. See that it is well cooked. See that it is served hygienically. See that it is has knowingly or UN knowingly no harmful items. For all the above reason if you feel the answer doesn't satisfy you then send food back. The food you are sending back need not to be paid for you have not touched it. In some cases of un cooked though you may tasted some you have right of health cautious. So don't eat for the above reason and simply send food back to pavilion (restaurant) 

Did any fish get overcooked

Yes, he had to give it to the cat is was so over cooked.
It was not mentioned so, no.

I decided that for Mother's Day I wanted to make a camping trip, so I called the camping grounds to reserve a space .  Once I confirmed that a space was reserved for a camping trip, I began to pack our belongings in art suitcases .  I packed pillows, bed sheets, pillows, food, medicine, toiletries, shoes, and anything else that I felt we needed to have with we while we were away .  Additionally, I ensure that we had bug repellent spray, hats and jackets to protect we while out in the wild .  We also brought pots, pans, gallons of water, eating utensils and even an electric griddle so that we could cook and eat - even if we did not have a stove or oven .  Once everything was packed, the luggage was all packed into the back of the truck as well, I also had to gather the camping tent, foldable chairs and sleeping bags for we trip, and load foldable chairs into the truck as well .  The last thing I needed to pack was some canned and nonperishable foods that could be cooked, along with things such as bread, snacks, soda and juice .  Now that we have covered everything from sleeping arrangements, clothing and food, and it was all packed in the truck as well and ready to go, the only thing left to do now was get in the truck as well and drive off on we way to we reservation . Get dressed in black or something nice get in car drive to funeral get out go inside sign your name in the big guest book greet people you know comfort those that have lost someone 

Why are they going camping

There the attendant took the film cover and went to find the corresponding film .  They brought back the corresponding film and told I I had three days for a store video rental .  I paid for a store video rental next .  Then I went home and watched the corresponding film .  A store video rental was enjoyable and I was pleased with I selection . The next day I returned the corresponding film to the store .  I did not want to forget to return the corresponding film because there are late fees for late movie returns .

I wanted to watch a movie and decided to rent one form a store video rental .  I drove to the store and entered the building .  The building was set up in sections according to movie genres; drama, comedy, horror, action, animated, thriller .  I decided to head to the drama section .  I looked through there available titles .  I picked out a recent release and brought the empty box up to the counter .  There the attendant took the film cover and went to find the corresponding film .  They brought back the corresponding film and told I I had three days for a store video rental .  I paid for a store video rental next .  Then I went home and watched the corresponding film .  A store video rental was enjoyable and I was pleased with I selection . The next day I returned the corresponding film to the store .  I did not want to forget to return the corresponding film because there are late fees for late movie returns .

Today I went to the sauna and relaxed in the room for thirty minutes .  I went with a friend and when we opened the door to the sauna, we realized that the door was cold .  I adjusted the comfortable temperature, on the outside of the sauna, and we waited inside of the sauna room while the coals of the heater warmed the room for thirty minutes up .  The room for thirty minutes took about five minutes to reach the comfortable temperature that I set the room for thirty minutes at and we sat in the room for thirty minutes for half an hour .  As we relaxed in the room for thirty minutes we had a conversation and when we felt as if we had spent enough time in the sauna we dried we off with the towels that we brought with we to the room .  After we dried off, we left the room for thirty minutes and I turned off the thermostat, of the sauna, so that the room for thirty minutes could cool back down .

We normally set a menu on Sunday for each day of the upcoming week to avoid chaos during dinner time .  Before I leave for the day in the morning, I am sure to put out the ingredients I need for the dinner ahead of time and defrost any meat I may need to prepare the meal .  At around five-thirty, I begin preparing the meal .  One meal I prepare often is ground turkey meatloaf and the seasoned green beans .  I mix the ground turkey with some bread crumbs, ketchup, and a bit of egg to bind the ground turkey .  I also lightly season the ground turkey for flavor .  I push the ground turkey into the loaf pan, and put the ground turkey in the oven to cook .  I then begin preparing the seasoned green beans .  I like to use fresh green beans .  They may involve the extra work of snapping off the ends before cooking They, but They taste so much fresher .  I season They with red pepper flakes and a little bit of lemon juice .  When the oven dings, dinner is ready for I family and I to enjoy . ask 'can i help you carry that?' . if they say yes then . grasp one end of the object . move the object to the desired location .

I was reading a great book in my favorite chair when suddenly the light went out .  I flicked the switch on I reading lamp, but the switch did I no good .  The switch looked like the old used-up light bulb had burned out .  I went to the hall closet and poked around, and luckily I found just what I needed, a package of light bulbs just like the one that had burned out .  I brought one of the new bulbs back to the living room, and unscrewed the old used-up light bulb .  I put the old used-up light bulb on the kitchen counter so I would see the old used-up light bulb in the morning and remember to recycle the old used-up light bulb at our city's transfer station .  Then I screwed the old used-up light bulb into the light socket and turned on the old used-up light bulb .  The light shone bright and clear .  I settled back into my favorite chair, and opened I book again . turn off light . wait for bulb to cool down . go to where bulb is . remove cover if any . remove old bulb . put in new bulb . put back cover .

This morning, like any other morning, I woke up still tired .  Coffee is something I require daily to function .  Up until last year, I used a regular coffee pot, and would brew about six cups, and drink most of a regular coffee pot .  Last year, for I birthday, I got a Keurig machine that brews individual cups .  It has become a hobby of I to collect different coffee and tea flavors, and try something new .  Today, I felt like having one of I fancier kinds of Coffee .  This kind is a Gevalia mocha latte .  This kind tastes like a hot chocolate and coffee blended together .  I added some water to I Keurig machine, and within a minute some water was ready to brew .  I put the k-cup into the slot on a Keurig machine that brews individual cups, and added the chocolate packet to an empty coffee mug .  Today I used I favorite teal coffee cup with birds and flowers on my favorite teal coffee cup .  A Keurig machine that brews individual cups sputtered out a delicious cup of coffee, I stirred the chocolate powder into Coffee until the chocolate powder was blended .  I grabbed a chair at I kitchen table, drank I delicious high-calorie breakfast, and was ready to take on the day . ask what kind of drink is desired . find the requested drink . prepare the drink for serving . offer the drink to the person who requested it . 

Why do they drink that kind of coffee.

I went for a driving lesson when I was sixteen years old .  In I town, a driving lesson when I was sixteen years old had to be 3 separate days of driving for two hours at a time .  I driver was very cool and relaxed .  Driving for the first time is a very nervous experience so the first time was good to have such a laid back guy as I instructor .  The first time helped to put all of the worries to rest .  I was very nervous at first .  But we started driving around town and I got more used to town .  In the instructor's car, the instructor's have pedals on the instructor's side of the instructor's car .  So that is a comfort knowing that the instructor's can take control of the instructor's car if anything goes wrong .  That really helped to make I worry a lot less .  Overall, the instructor's car was a very good experience and I felt very comfortable by the end of the instructor's car . turn knob to alarm . select desired time for alarm . turn know back to previous position . light will turn on the clock display when alarm is set .

I was invited for a party, and I had a very nice dress that I decided to wear .  But when I saw, it has one button missing .  So I had to fix it .  One button missing had 4 holes, so I wanted to fix in such a way that one button missing looks good .  So I had to choose exact matching color with I dress .  One button missing was golden .  I started to sew one button missing on back side so, the knot will not show up .  Then I poke I needle in one of the hole and stretched I thread all the way, then I inserted my needle in to the opposite side of hole .  When my needle went down, I pulled my needle all the way, and then, got my needle out from the hole as which was empty so far, and then from above again I will repeat the same thing and insert my thread opposite to that hole .  I will continue doing that till I feel like it is strong then I will make knot and fix knot firmly with button .  I job was done . get a new button get sewing kit place button where you want it use the string to make it stay in place put items away when done

2 summers ago, my brother and went on a trip to stay with our aunt's and our aunt's family for a whole week .  We spent the entire week before We left preparing for a trip .  The main thing that We needed to worry about was having clothes for a whole week .  Knowing this, We got our suitcases, and made sure to set aside different clothes, including underwear, for just about each day of the next week .  Then, We took some extra clothes for swimming just in case We would be doing this while We were over there .  After some extra clothes, We made sure to pack We toiletries, like toothbrushes, toothpaste, shampoo, and so on .  We packed our aunt's in a small bag the day before We left .  The last thing to pack was any other items We wanted to take with We .  I decided to take a blanket, and I brother decided to take a pillow .  We packed our aunt's into our suitcases, and once We were sure We had everything, We went off to our aunt's house . Find your convenient swimming pool Get a bag which carry waterproof dress and all the needy things. Be sure that your swim suit not too tight or not too loose also not too showy. Be sure you have soap, towel, shampoo of your choice in your bag. Always keep your mobile in water proof pouch. Before entering to swim pool do some warm up exercise. Don't play in water also don't swim and go beyond the warning limit.

I had been putting of visiting a doctor because my regular primary care provider was nearly a mile away, and I owed the money that I simply did not have .  I decide to visit an office that was much closer .  I was so glad I did because they had sliding scale fee that drastically reduced the cost of doctor visits and specialists that I desperately needed to see .  I filled out all the necessary paperwork and had a visit scheduled .  The date came and I went to see my regular primary care provider .  I had anxiety as I always do when seeing a medical professional .  She ended up being incredibly kind and understanding and She gave I a referral to see a chiropractor .  I was so happy that I was finally going to be able to see someone to help with I back pain .  I dislike narcotic painkillers and over the counter pain killers just do n't cut the counter most days .  Overall the counter was a positive experience and rather comedic that I was actually scared . drive to the dentist office go into the office and get checked in have a seat in the waiting room wait until you are called and doctor is ready for you. once called, go to the back and have a seat allow the hygienist to prepare you for doctor Receive your check up from the doctor  once done go back to the front show your insurance card or pay for your visit leave the office drive home 

Have they seen them before

no
Yes, they have a long standing patient doctor relationship.

After a day of washing and drying clothes, I gathered aside the clothing items .  I wanted to make sure to get rid of any wrinkles in them before hanging them up .  I then brought a separate basket upstairs and brought the ironing board out of the closet .  I unfolded the ironing board and got out the iron's cord from of the closet as well .  I brought the iron's cord to the sink so I could fill the iron's cord in order to use the steam function .  I then brought the iron to set it upon the ironing board .  I plugged the iron's cord into the socket .  As I heard the iron start to heat up, I set the first item to be ironed on the ironing board .  I flattened the pants on the ironing board so the creases would be right at the seams .  As I grazed the iron's cord across the pants, any wrinkles in them started to erase and I continued the process with the rest of the clothing items in a separate basket . Pick up all big things on the floor Put them in their proper spots Get vacuum Turn it on Vacuum the floor

There are several bills I have to pay each month with money I earn from working .  They include: I mortgage, My car payment, cell phone, TV/internet, electric, and credit card bills .  I set some time aside to check what I owe on each bill .  The mortgage is usually the highest .  Most bills I can pay online by using I computer .  I go the the website, enter an amount, and within a few clicks, the the website is paid for .  I car payment does n't have an easy-to-use online pay system, so for that I use I checkbook .  I take a check and write out the amount, who I am paying a check to -LRB- the bank's -RRB-, and sign I name .  I then put a check in an envelope with the bank's address on a check, attach a stamp, and drop a check off at I local mail box .  A check's not a long, or hard task, but a check's something I must do each month . identify bills that need to be paid . go to the bank with the account you pay bills with . select either 4 or 5 . go to the teller and pay your bill . go to the atm machine and pay from your account .

I am planning to travel from Atlanta to Singapore .  I note down some fares, and then I visited expedia and dunhill travel sites .   .  I liked the tripadvisor, after reviewing the site, and looking at the customer reviews .  The number was on site .  When I first talked to him, him gave I some options I think I got good deal, $1300 for round trip with stop at London for 14 hours and then directly to Singapore .  I liked that way because I wanted to see London also .  That way was good timing that I could go out see London and come back, and still I was left with ease .  I asked the agent, about any delaying problem, and cancellation .  Him told I if I add more $50 dollars, then I can change or cancel I trip without any penalty, and I did . go to where you are supposed to watch for them . look in direction where the kids will be coming from . wait specified length of time until they arrive .

While they are drying, I Febreeze the mattress and the pillows to freshen up the fabric and make sure nothing smells stuffy .  Once the sheets are dry, I begin by putting on the fitted sheet .  I spread sheet out evenly and flat, and then lay down the flat sheet over the fitted sheet .  I pull all of the corners, make sure everything lines up .  I Febreeze the down comforter, and then tie back on the corners of the duvet cover .  I button up the duvet cover, pulling the buttons inside so they do n't get caught on anything .

I woke up with I alarm and sluggishly got out of bed .  I went to the bathroom and turned out the light .  I went to the shower and turned the water on .  While the water was warming up I got a towel from the closet and undressed .  I stepped into the closet and grabbed the bottle of the shampoo I keep on the ledge .  I squirt some into I hand, about the size of a quarter .  I wet I hair and then rub in the shampoo .  I scrub I hair and can feel all the suds forming on I head .  After a few minutes of this I carefully rinse the soap out of I hair .  I do n't want to get my hair in I eyes .  I then grab I bottle of conditioner and repeat what I did with the shampoo .  This time though I leave the shampoo sit for a couple minutes so many hair can soak up those nutrients .  I then rinse off again making sure there's no soap what so ever left .  I shut off the closet and dry off, I hair now squeaky clean . ask 'can i help you carry that?' . if they say yes then . grasp one end of the object . move the object to the desired location .

Get into the shower and get your hair wet. Add shampoo to your hair while you get the rest of your body wet. Apply face wash. Scrub your body with soap or body wash, as desired. If you shave in the tub, do so now. Rinse your hair and add conditioner. Scrub your face while the conditioner works on your hair. Rinse off all over. Turn off the shower. Towel off.

I sometimes put the gift boxed in the gift box, if the gift boxed does n't already have one, to make the gift boxed easier to wrap .  The gift boxed's nice to put tissue paper inside the gift box, too .  That makes opening the gift boxed more interesting .  After I have the gift boxed, I assemble I wrapping supplies .  I use rolled wrapping paper, clear tape, scissors, and ribbon .  Next, I unroll some wrapping paper and place the gift box on top of the flat paper .  I study the flat paper, trying to figure out how much paper to cut off the roll .  I do n't want to waste paper, but I also want to neatly cover the gift boxed .  Once I decide how much paper to cut off, I mark the place with pencil, then fold there, and cut the flat paper along the fold line .  Now I turn the gift boxed upside down, and position the gift boxed in the center of the flat paper .  I pull up the other end of the paper smooth, and tape the flat paper to the center bottom of the gift box .  I pull the other end of the paper smooth, pull the other end of the paper smooth around the gift box and tape the other end of the paper smooth in place too .  Then I do the ends of the package, folding the flat paper down, cutting the package shorter if I must, and smoothing the other end of the paper smooth neatly around the gift box .  I tape the other end of the paper smooth in place, and decorate the gift box with pretty ribbon and bows to distract from any mistakes I may have made . walk up to phone . look at call display . call your wife over . tell her it s for her . make her pick up receiver . she says hello . you drift away quietly . 

Will she like opening the gift

No she will not.
Yes she will.

The last time that I washed the dishes, I first rounded up all of the dishes and placed all of the dishes in the sink .  I then went one by one until all of the dishes were all washed .  I first put water on all of the dishes and then soap and I used the sponge to clean all of the dishes thoroughly .  I lathered the sponge to clean them thoroughly all over each dish and then put all of the dishes each aside after I was done .  After drying each one, I put the sponge to clean them thoroughly aside to dry .  Soon after, everything was cleaned and I was able to start putting everything away .  I put everyone in the same spot that it always goes in and this continued in this example as well .  I let everything dry and I put everything exactly where it belonged . This process was somewhat time consuming, but overall, it was a routine and easy process .  I was able to wash all of the dishes and feel comfortable using all of the dishes . look around house for any dishes that are dirty . place all those dishes in the sick for washing .

To remove and replace a garbage bag, first lift the full garbage bag from the garbage can .  Some garbage bags have ties or the strings that are attached to Some garbage bags and can be used to close the top of the garbage bag by pulling on the strings until the opening completely closes .  Then the ends of the twist tie can be tied in a knot so a garbage bag will not open .  If a garbage bag does not have strings attached, use a twist tie to close the opening by gathering the top of the garbage bag together and wrapping a twist tie around the end of a garbage bag and twisting the ends of a twist tie together .  Take the full, closed garbage bag outside so the garbage man can pick the opening up .  Then, take a new garbage bag out of the box and unfold a new garbage bag before putting a new garbage bag in the garbage can .

Today was the start of Spring, so I decided Today was time to get some cleaning done .  The first and largest thing to deal with was I apartment flat .  I started by picking up any loose items that were not in their proper place .  I put as many items into drawers and closets as possible to reduce clutter .  I then moved all the furniture so I could clean the floors where all the furniture is normally sitting .  I vacuumed the exposed floor then moved all the furniture back into place with a couple changes in the arrangement for fun .  Then I swept the rest of the exposed floor after dusting any surfaces that needed the rest of the floor .  Afterwards, I cleaned all the windows, inside and out, and moved to the bathroom .  After wiping down all the surfaces in the bathroom with a disinfecting cleaner, I took a look around I flat to assess I work .  I apartment was now clean and my apartment felt great . pick up a task for clean up . gather all the things that need to be cleaned up . put items in their respective places .

I had been wanting to get I tattoo fixed for 5 years now and I just could n't seem to save up the several hundred dollars it would cost to get it fixed .  The other day the several hundred dollars it would cost to get it fixed dawned on mt that I could buy I own tattoo machine online .  I researched tattoo machines, needles and inks for the better part of a month at different online retailers before I decided on a retailer .  I then researched the product and how to use the product for a few more weeks .  I watched videos about the product, tutorials and user reviews .  I figured since I am an artist and pretty good at drawing and tracing that I would give the product a go .  I saved up amazon gift cards for several more weeks .  The product took a while but I eventually saved the better part of a hundred dollars, one dollar gift card at a time .  I decided to finally make I purchase and the product arrived two days later . do one of the following . go online the the store s webpage to see the store s hours . go to the store and see its hours of operation .

I had been wanting to get I tattoo fixed for 5 years now and I just could n't seem to save up the several hundred dollars it would cost to get it fixed .  The other day the several hundred dollars it would cost to get it fixed dawned on mt that I could buy I own tattoo machine online .  I researched tattoo machines, needles and inks for the better part of a month at different online retailers before I decided on a retailer .  I then researched the product and how to use the product for a few more weeks .  I watched videos about the product, tutorials and user reviews .  I figured since I am an artist and pretty good at drawing and tracing that I would give the product a go .  I saved up amazon gift cards for several more weeks .  The product took a while but I eventually saved the better part of a hundred dollars, one dollar gift card at a time .  I decided to finally make I purchase and the product arrived two days later . ask 'can i help you carry that?' . if they say yes then . grasp one end of the object . move the object to the desired location . 

Were they happy with their purchase

This morning I woke up and all the covers were off I bed .  Even though I do n't normally make up I bed, This morning my bed was necessary .  I decided to change all the sheets, since they were off anyway .  First, I removed all the sheets and the comforter .  I placed the comforter on the side .  I gathered up the sheets and pillow cases and brought the sheets and pillow cases to the laundry .  Next, I got out another set of clean sheets .  I unfolded the fitted sheet, that has elastic around the edges .  I stretched the flat sheet, making a nice tight area .  Next, I put the flat sheet on, tucking in the bottom and all the sides .  Next, I replaced the comforter, being sure that all the sides were hanging over the same amount .  I put clean pillow cases on the pillows and put clean pillow cases at the head of I bed .

This weekend, I decided I wanted to try baking my first cake .  I found a recipe online for an easy to make cake, printed out a list of the ingredients, and went to the grocery store to get the ingredients .  I knew about some of the common things, like eggs, flour, and sugar, but a list of the ingredients helped I get a lot of things I did n't own and would n't know to get .  When I got home, I followed a recipe as closely as I could, adding each of the ingredients at the exact amount of a recipe asked for .  I mixed them all up as described, and put them into a pan that I had borrowed from I mother .  I put a pan in the oven and let the cake cook .  I checked on the oven occasionally to see if the oven was looking OK, and because I was really excited to see how the oven was turning out .  When the oven was done in the oven I removed the oven, and applied an extra thick coat of frosting .  I was supposed to wait for my first cake, but I was too excited to try the oven out and ate the oven much sooner than recommended .  The oven was delicious . First see that you prepare the entire list for shopping Double check with the list you prepared is in low quantity or null in your house. A survey says that without prior list grocery shopping result in excess or double shopping In your favorite store take a trolley if more things to be purchased or a bag for small. First pick up the bottle things so that it goes in bottom of the trolley. Then shop for the packet items. Now time for oil, milk items so that it won't get crushed by other heavy things. Bill it in the counter. Pay for it . Get neatly packed and take it to home. The last but not least one is you must set right what you purchase in the same day at home 

Did they have to deviate from their initial plans for the cake at any point in the process

yes
no

The lawnmower's motor roared to loud life and I began pushing The lawnmower's motor through the grass in the yard in a methodical back-and-forth pattern so The grass on our front lawn would be evenly and neatly cut .
