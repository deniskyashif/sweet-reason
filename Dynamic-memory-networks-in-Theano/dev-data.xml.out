    <text>This past weekend, my family made so much food that there was still plenty of it going into the week. Knowing this, we chose not to make any new food, because we could still eat the leftover food from the weekend. All we would need to do was warm it up on the stove top. The stove is a gas stove, which produces a flame that, in my opinion, cooks food much better than an electric stove. On Monday after getting home from work, rather than making a new meal, my mom took some of the leftover food that we had saved from the weekend and put some of the food into a pan, and put a pan on The stove. My mom turned the gas on until the burner ignited, and left the heat on until my mom felt that the leftover food was warm enough. When my mom ate the heat, my mom swore the heat was as good as the heat was when the heat was freshly made.</text>

    <text>The other day, I finished reading the fourth book of the Game of Thrones Series. With the new season about to start on HBO, I wanted to get ahead of the show and continue reading the books in Thrones Series -- but I did not want to pay for the fourth book of the Game of Thrones Series. Remembering that I had a library card somewhere in my desk at home, I went home and found a library card somewhere in my desk. I went to the library and after browsing the fiction section, I finally found the fourth book of the Game of Thrones Series in Thrones Series and brought the fourth book of the Game of Thrones Series to the check out desk of the library. I handed over I information and library card and checked out the fourth book of the Game of Thrones Series, getting two weeks to read the fourth book of the Game of Thrones Series for free. I'm now a quarter of the way through the fourth book of the Game of Thrones Series and enjoy every page of the fourth book of the Game of Thrones Series while loving the fact that I taxes paid for I to read the fourth book of the Game of Thrones Series and I had to pay no extra money.</text>

    <text>One evening, I noticed my alarm clock had stopped working, because I had just checked my alarm clock, and my alarm clock showed a different time. I knew I had to change the new batteries in the same position. This is important as I need This to wake I up in time for work. I grabbed my alarm clock, turned my alarm clock upside down and located the slot for the new batteries in the same position. I lifted the plastic cover and checked what batteries the plastic cover required: two AA-sized batteries. The new batteries in the same position are quite common, and I got the new batteries in the same position from the kitchen drawer. I removed the new batteries in the same position by lifting the new batteries in the same position up, then I placed the new batteries in the same position, making sure the plus-side of the batteries -LRB- the little tip -RRB- were in the right direction, as the plus-side of the batteries -LRB- the little tip -RRB- is usually engraved on the plastic. I closed the lid carefully, and my alarm clock started ticking again. I adjusted the time with the help of I watch, and went to bed, knowing I would be woken up by I alarm at the right time the next morning.</text>

    <text>I was nervous about a date coming up with a friend later in the week. I wondered what could help I relax and feel better. I thought that a nice trip to the sauna would be good. The thought of the warm steam making me feel cozy seemed good. I drove I to the closest sauna and payed to go inside. I went into the sauna room first to change clothes. I did n't want any of the clothes I was wearing to get wet and steamy, so I brought a swimsuit to change into. The warm steam making me feel cozy works best when the warm steam making me feel cozy touches your skin, so your want to wear a swimsuit or a towel. I moved into the sauna room and sat on a bench in the warm steam making me feel cozy. The sauna room was very relaxing to be in there, like a hot bath. After a while, I left and changed back into I regular clothes. I felt much better and was not as nervous after visiting the sauna.</text>

    <text>I was excited to go to the museum and learn more about history. I waited in line with the other people wanting to go in, and when it was I turn I paid for I ticket and then went inside. There was so much to see! There was a room about different kinds of rocks and where different kinds of rocks came from. Another part of the museum had skeletons from all different kinds of old animals -- dinosaurs, a sabretooth tiger, and even a mammoth! The plaques next to The plaques told I all about when and where old animals lived. While I was at the museum, I moved from one room to the next and took I time to read as much as I could so I could really enjoy the trip. I spent all day learning about natural history, and there were still things I did n't get to see so I planned to return to the museum as soon as I could. Natural history was a wonderful day!</text>

    <text>Time to make breakfast! I'll get the coffee started because the coffee will be the perfect temperature by the time all the food is done. I grind my ground coffee beans and put filtered water into the electric kettle and get filtered water started. I need to put a filter in the Chemex and pour in my ground coffee beans. Meanwhile, I'll gather I ingredients from the fridge. I want eggs, butter, English Muffins, and my Canadian bacon. A breakfast sandwich sounds good. I'll get the English muffins toasted in the toaster. Filtered water just finished boiling, so filtered water's time to pour that in the Chemex over my ground coffee beans. I need to get the frying pan and put a little butter in there and turn on the frying pan. I grab and egg and scramble with a fork. The frying pan is heating and a little butter is melting I put I egg in and swirl a little butter to cover the bottom of the frying pan. While I wait for I eggs to set up, I'm going to microwave my Canadian bacon. Back to the eggs, they are almost set so I'll fold they into a half circle and flip. Grab I toasted English muffins on a plate. Layer my Canadian bacon and fold I freshly cooked eggs on top. I'll pour I a cup of coffee and now I can sit down for breakfast. Looks good.</text>

    <text>I was at camp and getting ready to lead a workshop teaching cooking on a campfire. Luckily it had not rained for a few days so all the wood in the area was dry. I had some large logs that were sitting by the fire ring so I went searching for some smaller sticks and kindling. I built a log cabin structure out of the larger logs. Inside a log cabin structure I put some very small tinder as well as some balled up pieces of the newspaper. I lit the newspaper and continued adding very small pieces of wood to the newspaper. When very small pieces of wood started catching I started adding larger twigs. As smaller pieces started catching on fire I kept added larger and larger twigs and sticks until the larger logs started burning. I continued to add sticks so I could get a nice sized fire burning that would create lots of hot coals so we could cook on lots of hot coals.</text>

    <text>First I go to the store and buy bread. For the freshest bread, I get a whole loaf and bring a whole loaf home to slice a whole loaf there. I use a bread knife which makes cutting a whole loaf easier, and cut off just what I need for the toast, leaving the rest whole. I wrap and store the remaining loaf for next time. Then I get the toaster out of the cabinet and place the toaster out of the cabinet on the counter, then plug the toaster out of the cabinet in. I choose the darkness of the freshest bread - not too dark, somewhere in the middle for flavor and safety - then indicate the slice thickness using the knob on the toaster out. I place the first two slices of bread in the slots and press down on the big button, which causes the bread to drop in and the toaster to get very hot. The timer counts down and I pay attention to The timer carefully, making sure the toast pops up and the toaster out turns off. I unplug The timer immediately but let The timer cool down before putting The timer away as The timer is very hot. I butter the freshest bread using a knife and then put away the knives and butter.</text>

    <text>I like to ride on trains because you can see lots of countryside without having to worry about driving. One time, when I lived in Alaska, I rode on the train to stop at the station to Denali park. Just like with all train rides, I had to buy a ticket first and then I had to stand in line to wait for the train to stop at the station. Then I climbed onto the train to stop at the station and picked a seat. The different places you can sit in a train are called cars. You do n't have assigned seats like on a plane and the seats are wide for more than one person to sit. So, I picked one in the very last car and sat right beside the window. After the train to stop at the station started moving, a train attendant walked through to check our tickets and then I stood up to walk around. You can walk from car to car on a train and can even go out of the back of the very last car and stand outside, so I did that. The very last car was very fun to be standing outside while the train to stop at the station was moving and I hung onto the railing to be sure I was safe. Then I went back inside and went to the dining car where I bought a sandwich and water. After I got back to I seat, I ate and watched the scenery through the window. I saw lots of interesting things including a moose and we arrived at Denali right after that.</text>

    <text>I miss I best friend Shelly's and so I decided to send Shelly's a letter telling Shelly's all about I trip to my sister's house in Alaska, and to also tell Shelly's that I hoped Shelly's was well. I finished writing a letter telling her all about my trip to my sister's house in Alaska and as I went to find a stamp and an envelope I needed to send a stamp, I had found that I did not have any. I went to a store that sells cards and envelopes, and chose a box of pretty purple-colored envelopes to mail a letter telling her all about my trip to my sister's house in Alaska in. After that I went to the post office to purchase some stamps that are like small stickers, and chose the heart design on it that I liked. I only needed one to send a letter telling her all about my trip to my sister's house in Alaska but I bought more so that I could send another letter soon if I wanted to. When I got home I filled out the envelope with Shelly's name and address in the middle, and wrote my sister's address in the top left corner of the envelope. I stuck a stamp with the heart design on it in the top left corner of the envelope. Now a stamp was ready to be put in the mail and she will receive a stamp in about one week. I drove to the post office and put a letter telling her all about my trip to my sister's house in Alaska in the outgoing mail slot. Shelly's will be so surprised!</text>

    <text>I needed to visit I Grandma upstate, so I decided to take a train. I purchased I tickets online and printed out a receipt. I packed a bag. The next day, I headed over to the train station and checked in at the ticket counter. I was early, so I picked a spot on a bench and sat down. After a short while, everybody lined up to get on a train. A train worker checked all of our tickets. I entered a train and picked out a seat for I. Then I loaded I bag overhead. Once everyone's was on a train, the train conductor announced that our were leaving the station. Another train worker came around and took everyone's tickets from Another train worker. I spent the ride looking at scenery out the window and reading mostly. Eventually, the train conductor announced I stop.

Then we discussed what we would like on we pizza and what size we should get. I called the number and gave we order to the person who answered. We ordered a large pepperoni and onion pizza with extra cheese. He told I that we pizza would cost $15.00. I said $15.00 would be fine and asked if a pizza could be delivered. He said, ``yes ''and asked for I address. I then gave He I name, address, and phone number. He told I that we pizza would be delivered in 30 minutes.

    <text>The previous night and this morning before work I noticed I was missing a lot of necessary ingredients for I future meals. I planned out a trip to the grocery store immediately after work. After I finished working I drove over to the store. It was very crowded but not too hard to find a parking spot. Once inside the store, I grabbed the nearest shopping cart and smiled as one of the grocery workers welcomed I in. Once inside and out of everyone's way, I thought about what I needed. Since I did n't have the list in my head, it took I a few minutes. Once I came up with the list in my head, I started to map out a route in my head that would take the least amount of time for I to follow in the store. First, I picked up I deli. They offered I some free samples of the meat I asked for. Then I picked up I bread which was right nearby. At the back wall of the store I found the meat I was going to cook tonight. After the meat I was going to cook tonight, I grabbed a few extra items that I thought might also be nice later this week while heading towards checkout. Luckily, there was n't a line and this was done quickly. I paid with I debit card and left with all my groceries in a cart, packed all my groceries into I car, and headed home.</text>

    <text>Last night after dinner, I had "dishwasher duty." That means that it was my turn to do the dishes and unload the dishwasher. After the dishwasher had washed the dishes, I first opened the door to the dishwasher. I unloaded the bottom rack first. That way, if any water drips or leftover food were stuck on the dishes still, they wouldn't trickle down to my clean dishes. The bottom drawer usually has my plates in it. After unloading the bottom drawer, I unloaded the top drawer, which usually contains my cups, utensils, and my bowls. I use a towel to dry off any leftover water drips. I then put all of the dishes back into the original cupboard places that they came from. That means that I put my plates in the cupboard near my sink, and I put my cups in the cupboard near my fridge. Lastly, I put my utensils and bowls in a cupboard near the microwave.</text>

    <text>I wanted to have a nice dinner with I friends and family, so I cooked all of our favorite foods and invited everyone over. I decided to go ahead and set the dining table before everyone arrived. I put the place mats in front of each chair at the dining table. I then placed dinner plates on each of the place mats.

I had never been to a sauna before but I had heard a lot of my friends talk about how much they loved a lot of my friends and how relaxing a lot of my friends was for they, so I figured I would give a lot of my friends a try. I got to the sauna and was greeted by a very calm and soothing employee who first directed I to a massage room. I waited and got a great massage which made I very relaxed and ready to go into the sauna. I entered the sauna and the first thing I noticed was that the sauna and the first thing I noticed smelled very woody, almost like being deep in a forest. The sauna and the first thing I noticed was also very hot inside but the sauna and the first thing I noticed was n't unpleasant. I sat down in the corner and closed I eyes, trying to relax. I spent about thirty minutes in the sauna enjoying the heat and took a shower when I was finally ready to leave. Going to the sauna was the perfect relaxation I needed after I stressful week!</text>

    <text>Last night, my friends and my wanted to make a bonfire. So, we made sure that we had some fire wood. We went to the back of her yard and gathered up some dry wood. My friend reminded we that some dry wood had to be dry, or else some dry wood would not burn very well. Next, we all helped out by placing the chunks of wood into the fire pit. Once we stacked some dry wood into the fire pit, My friend grabbed a lighter and lighter fluid. My friend poured some of the lighter fluid out onto the wood, and then used the lighter to light some dry wood. It took a few tries, but some dry wood finally caught on the fire, and we were able to start we bonfire. As the fire continued to burn, we added more wood or newspaper to keep the fire burning. We all had a fun time sitting around the fire and talking.</text>

    <text>Yesterday I made a flight reservation to fly from Boston to Chicago. The first step in making a flight reservation is to determine which airline you would like to fly. I picked American Airlines because I have most of I airline miles with American Airlines and I always like to earn more miles. I accessed the American Airlines website and entered the desired dates of I flight. The American Airlines website then provided I a bunch of different flight options for both I departing and returning flights. I selected the flights that worked the best for me and were the most affordable and I selected the flights that worked the best for me and were the most affordable. I was then directed to pay for I flight which I did via I American Airlines credit card. Once I flight was paid for I received an email confirming I transaction and providing I I flight details. I find that using the internet is much easier than calling the airlines for a flight reservation.</text>

    <text>We spent a week getting We gear together for our big camping trip. After making sure everything was packed and the tent had no holes from our big camping trip, We put everything into the car and set out on We way. After a four hour drive We arrived at the campgrounds. We found We spot and unpacked the car. First up was pitching the tent, then We set about making a fire to cook dinner. The tent took awhile to collect all the wood We needed and get the tent roaring, but once We got the food on a fire to cook dinner We could finally relax. After soaking in nature and enjoying We campfire meal, night had fallen and our campfire meal was time for bed. We curled up in We sleeping bags and told scary stories until We drifted off. The next morning We awoke early to stoke a fire to cook dinner and get breakfast started. A day of hiking and fishing went by far too fast and after another night under the stars We packed up We gear and headed home.</text>

    <text>It was a very hot sunny Saturday morning and me and me family decide to go to the beach. Before going to the beach we had to pack the car. We packed some snacks. We packed a cooler with all we drinks and water. We put on we bathing suits and brought towels, beach chairs, a beach umbrella, beach toys, and a beach ball. Mom brought sun tan lotion to protect we from the sun. Once we got to the beach mom and dad setup all off beach chairs, umbrella and towels. Mom laid down on a towel while Dad went running to the ocean. We swam but not too far because the water was very deep. There were a lot of waves and some people there were surfing with surfboards. There was other people that were playing volleyball on the beach and there were a lot of kids building sand castles. Dad helped we build we sand castle with a pool so that when the waves came in a pool would fill in we pool. At the beach there was also a tower for the lifeguards to see everyone in the water. There was a guy who went out too far into the water that the lifeguards had to blow the lifeguards whistle for the guy to come closer to the beach. The lifeguards have heard that sometimes you can see shark in the ocean but lucky for we we did not see any sharks. Visiting the beach was very fun for the whole family as Mom can relax and get a tan and dad could play and swim with we.</text>

    <text>Yesterday I hosted a barbecue for about twenty people. A barbecue was a really fun event and I enjoyed having my friends over to I beach house. To prepare for a barbecue I went shopping at the grocery store for hamburgers, hotdogs, rolls, chips, salad and soda. When I returned from the grocery store I prepared the salads and laid all of the food out to be cooked on the grill. As my friends began to arrive one of my friends volunteered to cook all of the food while the rest of us socialized and played volley ball. As the food was prepared us all enjoyed eating a burger or hot dog and then us quickly returned to playing different lawn games such as croquet and horseshoes. After a few hours my friends decided that the food was time to go home. Us really had a fun afternoon and I am excited to host a few more barbecues this summer.</text>

    <text>I need to buy a new dress, so I am going to the shopping centre. There are many stores there, so I am likely to find a nice dress. It is for a celebration I will attend. I drive to the center. It is three miles away and traffic is good. When I arrive, I easily find a parking space near the entrance. I walk to the entrance. The shopping center is very large and modern looking. The shopping center was only built two years ago. The shopping center has three levels. I enter the centre and begin strolling through the main level. The centre is not very crowded today. There are escalators that you can take to reach other levels. There are many large windows, so it is almost like being outdoors. I can smell coffee and cinnamon buns from one vendor. A few birds are inside, and A few birds fly around. There are pots with trees planted in A few birds. From where I am standing, I can see exactly which stores I want to go into. I am confident that I can find a nice dress.</text>

    <text>In the morning I felt hungry and decided to make I some scrambled eggs for breakfast. I took out a carton of eggs from the refrigerator and placed a carton of eggs from the refrigerator on the counter. From a carton of eggs from the refrigerator, I took three eggs and inspected three eggs for cracks. Three eggs looked fine, so I cracked three eggs into a small bowl being careful to to have any shells in a small bowl. I added a splash of water and then began to scramble three eggs with a whisk. Next I heated up a frying pan with a little butter in a frying pan. Once a frying pan was hot, I poured three eggs in a frying pan. After adding a dash of salt and pepper, I kept scrambling three eggs. Occasionally i would remove a frying pan from heat while scrambling for a short moment. Once three eggs looks firm and ready, I turned off the stove and plated three eggs to enjoy. I added a small sprig of parsley to the plate to make a small sprig of parsley look even fancier.</text>

    <text>Yesterday your father and I decided to go play a few rounds of tennis. Tennis is an outdoor sport game played usually with both people playing the game, sometimes there are two people on each team called pairs. There is a low net between both people playing the game. We use tennis rackets and tennis balls to hit the ball out back and forth to each other. Sometimes the other person can hit the ball out of bounds of the other person and that makes them miss the ball out so that person scores. The other person wins the set. We played for a few hours before both of We became extremely tired, then We came home. It was really a good workout for the both of We and We would like to take your to watch and play the next time We decide to play tennis.</text>

    <text>Sometimes for dinner I like to have the fish. When I want to have fish for dinner I will go to I local fish market and pick out something I like. Some times it might be salmon, sometimes tuna, or maybe a white fish like tilapia or flounder. I will buy a pound of it, and the fish monger will wrap it in wax paper and put it in a bag for I. Once I have it home, I check it, finding it clean and not smelling at all like fish. I will put it in a glass casserole dish and season it with salt, pepper, garlic, lemon, vinegar and olive oil. I might put a few onions in with olive oil. I will turn on the oven and while the oven gets hot I will make a salad. Once the oven is hot I will put the fish inside and set a timer. While the fish bakes, I will make other side dishes. When the timer rings I know its done and I carefully take its out with oven mitts. Its smells so good of garlic and its nice and cooked through. While I set the table, I let its cool and after a few minutes I serve I self a piece and I salad and side dishes.</text>

    <text>When I was younger, my mom wanted to make sure I would be safe around the water. My mom took I to the swimming pool to get better at it. One day, we went to the swimming pool and brought we towels. We got in the car and drove a few minutes to get there. Sometimes, I would get bored when I siblings would swim, so I brought the book The Lord of the Rings with I to read if I was bored. We made the book to the pool and they stamped we hands when we arrived. I went to sit down by the grass hill until it was I turn for a lesson. While I sat there, I read a book.

    <text>It was afternoon and I was not sure what I was going to fix for dinner. I asked my little boy and my little boy requested ham and cheese croissants. It is one of my little boy favorite meals to eat and also to help prepare. My little boy asked if my little boy could help with preparing dinner. First, we got an oven pan and lined an oven pan with Aluminum foil. We opened a can of croissants and unrolled them. My little boy cut each pastry triangle in half, so that each would be small and we could have more. My little boy placed a slice of ham on the croissant piece and sprinkled a slice of ham with shredded cheddar cheese. We began rolling up each piece from the long side, all the way until there was the croissant piece, ham and cheese rolled up. We placed ham and cheese on the baking sheet and put ham and cheese in the oven. In 15 minutes, ham and cheese were golden brown and baked with love from I baby!</text>

    <text>I decided that for Mother's Day I wanted to make a camping trip, so I called the camping grounds to reserve a space. Once I confirmed that a space was reserved for a camping trip, I began to pack our belongings in art suitcases. I packed pillows, bed sheets, pillows, food, medicine, toiletries, shoes, and anything else that I felt we needed to have with we while we were away. Additionally, I ensure that we had bug repellent spray, hats and jackets to protect we while out in the wild. We also brought pots, pans, gallons of water, eating utensils and even an electric griddle so that we could cook and eat - even if we did not have a stove or oven. Once everything was packed, the luggage was all packed into the back of the truck as well, I also had to gather the camping tent, foldable chairs and sleeping bags for we trip, and load foldable chairs into the truck as well. The last thing I needed to pack was some canned and nonperishable foods that could be cooked, along with things such as bread, snacks, soda and juice. Now that we have covered everything from sleeping arrangements, clothing and food, and it was all packed in the truck as well and ready to go, the only thing left to do now was get in the truck as well and drive off on we way to we reservation.</text>

    <text>It was a cool spring evening and we wanted to have a family get together on the beach around a bonfire. After getting permission from the city, we began to plan the night. First we went to a local man and bought all of the necessary bonfire wood, which is much bigger than the very long logs. We went to the grocery store to pick up all of the necessary ingredients for a cookout next to the bonfire. We bought burgers, hot dogs, and buns for each. We made sure we had every vegetable available to go onto a burger including condiments and cheeses. We picked up several bags of chips and ingredients for s'mores. We arrived at the beach around a bonfire just before sunset and built a bonfire with the very long logs. Once we felt like they were all in place, we lit the fire and began to cook so everything would be ready for we guests once they arrived.</text>

    <text>We were excited about the awesome new mall and planned all week to visit the awesome new mall this past weekend! I called I sisters and friends and We all decided to meet in the front at noon on Saturday. There was plenty of parking and nice security cameras to keep We safe. We walked in the first large store and everyone decided to split up and meet at the food court two hours later. Alone, I looked at the ladies shoes. I bought a pair of dress up shoes and walked over to the nearby makeup. Both were having a promotion so I bought I favorite kind to get a free bag and then checked out a new kind before I bought some and lipstick. Both were priced great. Next, I went to the housewares section and bought a coffee maker in black. Hand mixers were on sale across the isle so I bought one for the camp. The color I chose is red to match the blender. Next, I left the first large store and went to nearby children's store to pick out toys for I kids. Four games and two balls looked great and exactly what Four games and two balls would like. Then I spotted some outdoor clothing and searched for something to give I to a little relief from daily laundry. After I went to a wonderful new ladies purse store and bought a new Gucci for the job interview ahead, I realized the job interview was time to meet at the food court. Realizing the job interview was all the way across the awesome new mall, I hurriedly walked that way and saw I friends and sisters standing in front waiting. We shared some strawberry ice cream and coffee before We walked back to We cars and said goodbye. As I drove home and thought about I purchases and good time with friends and family, I smiled. I live in a nice city.</text>

    <text>We normally set a menu on Sunday for each day of the upcoming week to avoid chaos during dinner time. Before I leave for the day in the morning, I am sure to put out the ingredients I need for the dinner ahead of time and defrost any meat I may need to prepare the meal. At around five-thirty, I begin preparing the meal. One meal I prepare often is ground turkey meatloaf and the seasoned green beans. I mix the ground turkey with some bread crumbs, ketchup, and a bit of egg to bind the ground turkey. I also lightly season the ground turkey for flavor. I push the ground turkey into the loaf pan, and put the ground turkey in the oven to cook. I then begin preparing the seasoned green beans. I like to use fresh green beans. They may involve the extra work of snapping off the ends before cooking They, but They taste so much fresher. I season They with red pepper flakes and a little bit of lemon juice. When the oven dings, dinner is ready for I family and I to enjoy.</text>

    <text>I was reading a great book in my favorite chair when suddenly the light went out. I flicked the switch on I reading lamp, but the switch did I no good. The switch looked like the old used-up light bulb had burned out. I went to the hall closet and poked around, and luckily I found just what I needed, a package of light bulbs just like the one that had burned out. I brought one of the new bulbs back to the living room, and unscrewed the old used-up light bulb. I put the old used-up light bulb on the kitchen counter so I would see the old used-up light bulb in the morning and remember to recycle the old used-up light bulb at our city's transfer station. Then I screwed the old used-up light bulb into the light socket and turned on the old used-up light bulb. The light shone bright and clear. I settled back into my favorite chair, and opened I book again.</text>

    <text>This morning, like any other morning, I woke up still tired. Coffee is something I require daily to function. Up until last year, I used a regular coffee pot, and would brew about six cups, and drink most of a regular coffee pot. Last year, for I birthday, I got a Keurig machine that brews individual cups. It has become a hobby of I to collect different coffee and tea flavors, and try something new. Today, I felt like having one of I fancier kinds of Coffee. This kind is a Gevalia mocha latte. This kind tastes like a hot chocolate and coffee blended together. I added some water to I Keurig machine, and within a minute some water was ready to brew. I put the k-cup into the slot on a Keurig machine that brews individual cups, and added the chocolate packet to an empty coffee mug. Today I used I favorite teal coffee cup with birds and flowers on my favorite teal coffee cup. A Keurig machine that brews individual cups sputtered out a delicious cup of coffee, I stirred the chocolate powder into Coffee until the chocolate powder was blended. I grabbed a chair at I kitchen table, drank I delicious high-calorie breakfast, and was ready to take on the day.</text>

    <text>I went for a driving lesson when I was sixteen years old. In I town, a driving lesson when I was sixteen years old had to be 3 separate days of driving for two hours at a time. I driver was very cool and relaxed. Driving for the first time is a very nervous experience so the first time was good to have such a laid back guy as I instructor. The first time helped to put all of the worries to rest. I was very nervous at first. But we started driving around town and I got more used to town. In the instructor's car, the instructor's have pedals on the instructor's side of the instructor's car. So that is a comfort knowing that the instructor's can take control of the instructor's car if anything goes wrong. That really helped to make I worry a lot less.

    <text>When I was a boy scout, we went fishing to a lake. When we were on the lake -LRB- the lake was frozen -RRB-, we decided to fish for the fish out. We drilled a hole into the lake and caught a lot. We wanted to cook them, so we cleaned them out of all the nasty stuff in them body and started the fire with hot gloves. When the fire with hot gloves was getting calmed down, the hot coals started to steam. When the fire with hot gloves started steaming, we got the fish out and put the fire with hot gloves on a cast iron pan. We put a cast iron pan on the middle of the fire with hot gloves with the lid on the fire with hot gloves and we waited while the fish out cooked. The fire with hot gloves smelled really good to we, especially with how hungry that we were. After the fire with hot gloves started to smell almost burned, we took a cast iron pan off of the fire with hot gloves and ate the fish inside when cooled.</text>

    <text>I am so excited to learn how to drive today with Scott. We are in a large vacant parking lot and no one else is around so it will be perfectly safe for We, the car and anyone else. As We both get in the car, We put on We seatbelts. Check. Now he instructs I to put the key in the ignition and give the key in the ignition a gentle turn forward toward the front of the car. I hear the key in the ignition crank and can feel the key in the ignition hum. He tells I to grab the crankshaft and put the crankshaft into the ``D ''position. I feel the car surge forward and immediately hit the brake pedal on the left and car stops. He tells I the car surge's fine and to give the car surge a little gas. The car begins to move forward as travel in a straight line. The more gas I give the car from the pedal on the right, the faster We go!</text>

    <text>I love shopping online. Last weekend I wanted to order some vitamins. I looked on two web sites to find exactly the kind of vitamins I wanted. And I also looked at prices. I even tried to find some near I so that some near me would be shipped to I quick. The quickest way to get some near me and not have to pay too much money would cause some near me to get to I in four days. So I decided to order and wait. On Monday morning there was a package by I front door. I opened a package by my front door. A package by my front door was the vitamins. A package by my front door took less than 24 hours for some near me to get to I. I was happy the vitamins were here. I tried to figure out how some near me go to I so quick. Then I figured out that some near me came from an Amazon facility near I. I might order from Amazon again since some near me got here quick.</text>

    <text>Last night I decided to make Mexican Bean Salad for dinner. This is a really nice, light, and flavorful dish to eat during the summer. I looked up the recipe and took out a notepad and a pen so I could make a list of all of the ingredients I needed to get at the grocery store on I way home from work. Some of the ingredients I already had - like olive oil, red wine vinegar, garlic, and cumin. However, I needed many of the other necessary ingredients in order to make the recipe. On I shopping list, I wrote that I needed one can of black beans, one can of kidney beans, one can of cannellini beans, a bag of frozen corn, one red onion, one green bell pepper, one red bell pepper, and one bunch of cilantro. I put my shopping list in I purse so I could reference my shopping list later at the grocery store on my way home and make sure I buy everything that I need for dinner.</text>

    <text>This morning when I woke up, I noticed something was strange about I alarm clock. Instead of being loud, like normal, my alarm clock was fairly faint, and changing volume on my alarm clock's own. The alarm clock light was also flickering a lot on the time readout. I figured that the batteries were probably dying, so I decided to change the batteries. First, I looked in I cabinet to see if I had any spare batteries. I did n't, so I drove to the grocery store to pick up some replacements. I bought two AA batteries, and returned home with two AA batteries. I found I flat head screwdriver in I tool box, and used my flat head screwdriver to pry open the battery compartment on the bottom of I alarm clock. I then dislodged two AA batteries with I fingers, and placed the new ones in the slots, with the positive and negative ends lining up appropriately. Finally, I put the battery cover back on and saw the alarm clock light up brightly.</text>

    <text>I was invited for a party, and I had a very nice dress that I decided to wear. But when I saw, it has one button missing. So I had to fix it. One button missing had 4 holes, so I wanted to fix in such a way that one button missing looks good. So I had to choose exact matching color with I dress. One button missing was golden. I started to sew one button missing on back side so, the knot will not show up. Then I poke I needle in one of the hole and stretched I thread all the way, then I inserted my needle in to the opposite side of hole. When my needle went down, I pulled my needle all the way, and then, got my needle out from the hole as which was empty so far, and then from above again I will repeat the same thing and insert my thread opposite to that hole. I will continue doing that till I feel like it is strong then I will make knot and fix knot firmly with button. I job was done.</text>

    <text>2 summers ago, my brother and went on a trip to stay with our aunt's and our aunt's family for a whole week. We spent the entire week before We left preparing for a trip. The main thing that We needed to worry about was having clothes for a whole week. Knowing this, We got our suitcases, and made sure to set aside different clothes, including underwear, for just about each day of the next week. Then, We took some extra clothes for swimming just in case We would be doing this while We were over there. After some extra clothes, We made sure to pack We toiletries, like toothbrushes, toothpaste, shampoo, and so on. We packed our aunt's in a small bag the day before We left. The last thing to pack was any other items We wanted to take with We. I decided to take a blanket, and I brother decided to take a pillow.

I was so glad I did because they had sliding scale fee that drastically reduced the cost of doctor visits and specialists that I desperately needed to see. I filled out all the necessary paperwork and had a visit scheduled. The date came and I went to see my regular primary care provider. I had anxiety as I always do when seeing a medical professional. She ended up being incredibly kind and understanding and She gave I a referral to see a chiropractor. I was so happy that I was finally going to be able to see someone to help with I back pain. I dislike narcotic painkillers and over the counter pain killers just do n't cut the counter most days. Overall the counter was a positive experience and rather comedic that I was actually scared.</text>

    <text>Samantha was so excited to go to Samantha new friend's seventh birthday party; it was going to be Spider-Man themed and Samantha loved Spider-Man! Her new friend's was going to start in 1 hour and her new friend's was time for Samantha to get ready to go, so Samantha ran as fast as Samantha could into Samantha room to grab Samantha party clothes. When Samantha reached into Samantha drawer to grab Samantha prettiest dress - It was a beautiful pink color with pretty purple flowers and polka dots on It - Samantha found that her prettiest dress looked ruined! Her prettiest dress was wrinkled and bunched up from being shoved into Samantha drawer for so long underneath all Samantha other clothes. Samantha ran to Samantha mom in a panic, saying Samantha could n't make a panic to the party with a ruined dress! Samantha mom smiled and told Samantha it was going to be okay, then Samantha pulled out something Samantha called an Ironing Board, which Samantha explained would help Samantha get the wrinkles out of her prettiest dress without hurting something she called an Ironing Board, which she explained would help her get the wrinkles out of the pretty dress. Samantha mom ironed her prettiest dress and sure enough, her prettiest dress was then free of wrinkles and Samantha was ready to go to the birthday party!</text>

    <text>After a day of washing and drying clothes, I gathered aside the clothing items. I wanted to make sure to get rid of any wrinkles in them before hanging them up. I then brought a separate basket upstairs and brought the ironing board out of the closet. I unfolded the ironing board and got out the iron's cord from of the closet as well. I brought the iron's cord to the sink so I could fill the iron's cord in order to use the steam function. I then brought the iron to set it upon the ironing board. I plugged the iron's cord into the socket. As I heard the iron start to heat up, I set the first item to be ironed on the ironing board. I flattened the pants on the ironing board so the creases would be right at the seams. As I grazed the iron's cord across the pants, any wrinkles in them started to erase and I continued the process with the rest of the clothing items in a separate basket.</text>

I already had the noodles at I house. I drove my car to I nearest supermarket. I grabbed a shopping cart and entered the store. I strolled the aisles until I found the Italian food isle. I looked around for my favorite spaghetti sauce and found my favorite spaghetti sauce. I put my favorite spaghetti sauce into a shopping cart and proceeded to go to the bakery section. I ordered some freshly baked Italian bread rolls. I put all the items into a shopping cart and started making I way towards the cashier check out. I placed all the items on the cashier desk and paid for all the items. After paying I went back to I car in the parking lot and placed all the items inside my car. I drove home and started boiling the pasta and heating up my favorite spaghetti sauce. I put the bread into the oven to heat the bread up. After 20 minutes the meal was ready and I sat down at the table with my family and enjoyed the meal. When I was done I washed the dishes and dinner was finished.</text>

    <text>Yes going on a train, this is was our ideal weekend activity not too long ago. Our purchased tickets to travel from Boston to New York City. As our entered the platform of the train is was pure steel and looked so solidly strong. Our walked down the isle and found an comfortable looking seat and decided to sit there. Shortly the train horn blasted making me jump of me seat lol. Anyway our soon started moving and our train ride was underway. The conductor walked the isles and collected our tickets. Love scenery so me had the window seat watching everything along the way. First me saw large suburban areas but as our got into Connecticut many farms were being spotted. It was n't very hilly but sure was a country atmosphere. Soon our approached NYC and the train came to slow stop, our had arrived at our destination. Our train ride overall was rather smooth and our train ride did n't seem to take all that long.</text>

    <text>I saw from I alarm clock that my alarm clock was time to feed I fish. I tend to feed them every day at 5:00 pm. I walked over to the tank to see how them were doing. Them were swimming around and ready to be fed. I grabbed I jar of The scooped food and screwed the cap. Then I scooped out just enough food to feed them for one day. The scooped food went right into the water. I fish were in a slight frenzy to get fed. Them swam all at once to the surface to eat up The scooped food that I had given them. In a short while, most of The scooped food had disappeared from the surface of the water. My fish appeared to be eating healthily so i began to put things away. I then closed the top of the tank, and replaced the cap on The scooped food. I put The scooped food away for another day.</text>

There are several bills I have to pay each month with money I earn from working. They include: I mortgage, My car payment, cell phone, TV/internet, electric, and credit card bills. I set some time aside to check what I owe on each bill. The mortgage is usually the highest. Most bills I can pay online by using I computer. I go the the website, enter an amount, and within a few clicks, the the website is paid for. I car payment does n't have an easy-to-use online pay system, so for that I use I checkbook. I take a check and write out the amount, who I am paying a check to -LRB- the bank's -RRB-, and sign I name. I then put a check in an envelope with the bank's address on a check, attach a stamp, and drop a check off at I local mail box.

    <text>When ever I want to make any reservation, I always do online, so I can get good deals. I first went to travel sites -LRB- trip advisor -RRB- to see if any good deal is there. I am planning to travel from Atlanta to Singapore. I note down some fares, and then I visited expedia and dunhill travel sites. . I liked the tripadvisor, after reviewing the site, and looking at the customer reviews. The number was on site. When I first talked to him, him gave I some options I think I got good deal, $1300 for round trip with stop at London for 14 hours and then directly to Singapore. I liked that way because I wanted to see London also. That way was good timing that I could go out see London and come back, and still I was left with ease. I asked the agent, about any delaying problem, and cancellation. Him told I if I add more $50 dollars, then I can change or cancel I trip without any penalty, and I did.</text>

My try to straighten that first but the alarm clock is still not working. My have to assume the back of the alarm clock where the batteries are must be the batteries. My take the old batteries out of the alarm clock where the batteries are and look them over for corrosion. Them look fine, so maybe them are just old. My place the new batteries in the alarm clock where the batteries are and My make sure them make contact with the metal parts and face the right direction. Check. My slide the back of the alarm clock where the batteries are back on and flip the alarm clock where the batteries are over. My turn the on switch on and the on switch lights up. All My have to do now is reset the time and My'm good to go.</text>

    <text>Terri likes to vacuum the carpet, the carpet is one of Terri chores Terri does every other day. After school, Terri has a small list of little chores to do around the house. Terri has to vacuum the living room and hallway for those days. So, on one of those days, Terri takes out the vacuum cleaner, unwinds the cord, plugs the cord in, and adjusts the height of the vacuum. This way, the cord is low to the ground, and gets all the dirt up. Terri then hits the button for start, and the button for start turns on. Terri pushes the button for start gently across the carpet and floors of the living room and hallway. Terri makes sure that Terri gets the edges and under any carpets that are movable. Terri also vacuums under the front of the couch. When Terri is done, Terri turns off the machine, empties all the dirt into the trash can, and pops the container back onto the vacuum. Terri rolls up the cord, and returns the cord back to the closet.</text>

    <text>My favorite fish to cook is a fun and cool activity that many people can do because there are so many steps. First the step is to find a good sized fish. Now I know what your thinking, and your can not just grab any ole fish out of a tank or something your found in a stream. Your need a good fish with lots of meat and food on a stream. I favorite fish to cook is probably drum, so once your have a good nice drum your first have to cut a stream. Get all the meat off of a stream and then there are a number of ways to cook a stream. I like to fry I fish, so I season a stream with a number of thinks and then make sure to cover a stream in flour and bread crumbs. I then heat the oil I will be using to fry a stream to a very hot temperature and then dunk a good sized fish until a stream is nice and brown.</text>

I Febreeze the down comforter, and then tie back on the corners of the duvet cover. I button up the duvet cover, pulling the buttons inside so they do n't get caught on anything.

    <text>I woke up with I alarm and sluggishly got out of bed. I went to the bathroom and turned out the light. I went to the shower and turned the water on. While the water was warming up I got a towel from the closet and undressed. I stepped into the closet and grabbed the bottle of the shampoo I keep on the ledge. I squirt some into I hand, about the size of a quarter. I wet I hair and then rub in the shampoo. I scrub I hair and can feel all the suds forming on I head. After a few minutes of this I carefully rinse the soap out of I hair. I do n't want to get my hair in I eyes. I then grab I bottle of conditioner and repeat what I did with the shampoo. This time though I leave the shampoo sit for a couple minutes so many hair can soak up those nutrients. I then rinse off again making sure there's no soap what so ever left. I shut off the closet and dry off, I hair now squeaky clean.</text>

Then I folded t-shirts. First I laid them flat, then i folded on arm inwards and then the other. Then I folded the bottom of the shirt upward and the top downwards. After shirts, I moved on to underpants. I folded them halfways from the center and then top to bottom. Next came pants. I lined up the seams and folded them in half longways, and then from the top to the center then the bottom to the center. I matched up socks and laid one on top of the other. Then I took the cuffs about a third of the way down to keep each with the cuffs's matching partner. Then I put I folded clothes away in drawers.</text>

In order to do this, we first picked the pasta out of the cabinet and opened up the box. We then boiled the water, before putting the pasta in. As we put the pasta in, we stirred the pasta and watched the water boil. After putting in spices and watching the pasta for about five to ten minutes, we tried one piece of pasta to see if one piece of pasta was soft enough to eat. Upon trying the food and enjoying the taste, we put the meat sauce on the pasta and let the meat sauce get hot.

    <text>I had a pile of clothes that needed to be washed. First I separated the white clothes from the colored clothes. I washed the white clothes first. I put the white clothes into the washing machine. I then put laundry soap in. I also put about a cup of bleach in. Bleach helps make the white clothes stay white. I turned on the washing machine by setting the dial to the the amount of time to wash the white clothes. I also set a knob for how full the washer was. I also set the temperature of the water. After the white clothes were done washing I put the white clothes into the dryer for 30 minutes. I set the dryer for 30 minutes because I think that is how long it will take to try the white clothes. I did everything above for the colored clothes except put in bleach. I only washed 2 loads of clothes.</text>

    <text>This weekend I went to a bonfire with I friends. It was the weekend before graduation so there was a lot of people present there. I knew most of the people since I've grown up with the people. We had a really good time. We all sat around the bonfire and ate snacks while sharing stories of old times. We also talked about what the future could hold for all of We. We were starting on a new road soon, We were all getting a fresh start, and a fresh start was so very exciting. I could n't wait to start college in the fall as I'm sure most of I friends felt the same way. I was having such a great night though, I was sad that it would soon come to an end and it could be years before I saw all those people again. I felt happy though that I went to the bonfire.</text>

    <text>I sometimes put the gift boxed in the gift box, if the gift boxed does n't already have one, to make the gift boxed easier to wrap. The gift boxed's nice to put tissue paper inside the gift box, too. That makes opening the gift boxed more interesting. After I have the gift boxed, I assemble I wrapping supplies. I use rolled wrapping paper, clear tape, scissors, and ribbon. Next, I unroll some wrapping paper and place the gift box on top of the flat paper. I study the flat paper, trying to figure out how much paper to cut off the roll. I do n't want to waste paper, but I also want to neatly cover the gift boxed. Once I decide how much paper to cut off, I mark the place with pencil, then fold there, and cut the flat paper along the fold line. Now I turn the gift boxed upside down, and position the gift boxed in the center of the flat paper. I pull up the other end of the paper smooth, and tape the flat paper to the center bottom of the gift box. I pull the other end of the paper smooth, pull the other end of the paper smooth around the gift box and tape the other end of the paper smooth in place too. Then I do the ends of the package, folding the flat paper down, cutting the package shorter if I must, and smoothing the other end of the paper smooth neatly around the gift box. I tape the other end of the paper smooth in place, and decorate the gift box with pretty ribbon and bows to distract from any mistakes I may have made.</text>

    <text>Yesterday afternoon, my sister and my went to the outdoor neighborhood swimming The pool. The pool requires that visitors either live in the neighborhood or be guests of a neighborhood resident in order to enter, and because we met those criteria, we had no problems getting in. The day was sunny and above eighty degrees. My wore my teal one-piece swimsuit and my sister wore my sister's pink bikini. After we had walked to the pool from we house, we both lathered up with sunscreen and laid we towels and pool bags on vacant lounge chairs. There were only a dozen people at The pool. One of only a dozen people was my sister's friend, so my sister's left immediately to go splash around with my sister's and hang out on a raft. My ordered a raspberry smoothie and laid out with my copy of ``Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire ''while the sun heated my skin. When my started to sweat, my rinsed off in the provided shower and then put on my goggles and got into The pool to swim laps. Thankfully, the lap swim lane was clear, and my got a good work-out in. The day started to cloud over, and my sister's friend left, so after that the two of we sat in the shallow end of The pool with the warm water rising to we shoulders and chatted until we had both had we fill of pool time. We wrapped we in we towels, put we flip-flops on, and walked home from The pool.</text>

    <text>The last time that I washed the dishes, I first rounded up all of the dishes and placed all of the dishes in the sink. I then went one by one until all of the dishes were all washed. I first put water on all of the dishes and then soap and I used the sponge to clean all of the dishes thoroughly. I lathered the sponge to clean them thoroughly all over each dish and then put all of the dishes each aside after I was done. After drying each one, I put the sponge to clean them thoroughly aside to dry. Soon after, everything was cleaned and I was able to start putting everything away. I put everyone in the same spot that it always goes in and this continued in this example as well.

    <text>To remove and replace a garbage bag, first lift the full garbage bag from the garbage can. Some garbage bags have ties or the strings that are attached to Some garbage bags and can be used to close the top of the garbage bag by pulling on the strings until the opening completely closes. Then the ends of the twist tie can be tied in a knot so a garbage bag will not open. If a garbage bag does not have strings attached, use a twist tie to close the opening by gathering the top of the garbage bag together and wrapping a twist tie around the end of a garbage bag and twisting the ends of a twist tie together. Take the full, closed garbage bag outside so the garbage man can pick the opening up. Then, take a new garbage bag out of the box and unfold a new garbage bag before putting a new garbage bag in the garbage can. You can fold the top edge of a garbage bag over the rim of the can so that garbage does not get between the can and a garbage bag.</text>

    <text>I love to make hot chocolate in the wintertime. Today it snowed so I decided to make I a mug of hot cocoa. Some people just put a mug of water in the microwave and then add Swiss Miss.. Not I. I use milk in I. First I put the milk in a sauce pan. Then I put the milk on the burner on medium high heat. While the milk is heating up I get mix cocoa and sugar together. I have to be careful while boiling milk because once I did milk for too long. Then a skin formed on top and milk was gross. I learned after that that as soon as a skin boils I need to pull a skin off the burner.Once the milk comes to a boil I pour a skin into a mug. Then I add hot cocoa. Then I stir and enjoy hot cocoa in front of I fireplace.</text>

    <text>Today was the start of Spring, so I decided Today was time to get some cleaning done. The first and largest thing to deal with was I apartment flat. I started by picking up any loose items that were not in their proper place. I put as many items into drawers and closets as possible to reduce clutter. I then moved all the furniture so I could clean the floors where all the furniture is normally sitting. I vacuumed the exposed floor then moved all the furniture back into place with a couple changes in the arrangement for fun. Then I swept the rest of the exposed floor after dusting any surfaces that needed the rest of the floor. Afterwards, I cleaned all the windows, inside and out, and moved to the bathroom. After wiping down all the surfaces in the bathroom with a disinfecting cleaner, I took a look around I flat to assess I work. I apartment was now clean and my apartment felt great!</text>

    <text>Cleaning the table is done after every meal. Sometimes people make a big mess when people eat and sometimes not. It sometimes depends on what we eat. Usually I like to get the plates off the table first. If there is not much food left on the plates then I will stack the plates on top of each other with the dirtiest plate on top. And I take the dishes to the sink. Next I get the silverware and take the dishes to the sink. If there is food left I remove the food from the table and put the food into bowls to be saved in the refrigerator as left overs. Glasses, coffee cups and dessert plates will be removed from table. Sometimes there are place mats to be removed or a table cloth. One of the last things to do is wipe the table to make sure it is clean.</text>

    <text>I had been wanting to get I tattoo fixed for 5 years now and I just could n't seem to save up the several hundred dollars it would cost to get it fixed. The other day the several hundred dollars it would cost to get it fixed dawned on mt that I could buy I own tattoo machine online. I researched tattoo machines, needles and inks for the better part of a month at different online retailers before I decided on a retailer. I then researched the product and how to use the product for a few more weeks. I watched videos about the product, tutorials and user reviews. I figured since I am an artist and pretty good at drawing and tracing that I would give the product a go. I saved up amazon gift cards for several more weeks. The product took a while but I eventually saved the better part of a hundred dollars, one dollar gift card at a time. I decided to finally make I purchase and the product arrived two days later.</text>

    <text>This morning I woke up and all the covers were off I bed. Even though I do n't normally make up I bed, This morning my bed was necessary. I decided to change all the sheets, since they were off anyway. First, I removed all the sheets and the comforter. I placed the comforter on the side. I gathered up the sheets and pillow cases and brought the sheets and pillow cases to the laundry. Next, I got out another set of clean sheets. I unfolded the fitted sheet, that has elastic around the edges. I stretched the flat sheet, making a nice tight area. Next, I put the flat sheet on, tucking in the bottom and all the sides. Next, I replaced the comforter, being sure that all the sides were hanging over the same amount. I put clean pillow cases on the pillows and put clean pillow cases at the head of I bed.

I said to the waiter, this is not what I had placed I order for. The waiter said that The waiter was sorry and took me a pumpkin back.

    <text>This weekend, I decided I wanted to try baking my first cake. I found a recipe online for an easy to make cake, printed out a list of the ingredients, and went to the grocery store to get the ingredients. I knew about some of the common things, like eggs, flour, and sugar, but a list of the ingredients helped I get a lot of things I did n't own and would n't know to get. When I got home, I followed a recipe as closely as I could, adding each of the ingredients at the exact amount of a recipe asked for. I mixed them all up as described, and put them into a pan that I had borrowed from I mother. I put a pan in the oven and let the cake cook. I checked on the oven occasionally to see if the oven was looking OK, and because I was really excited to see how the oven was turning out. When the oven was done in the oven I removed the oven, and applied an extra thick coat of frosting. I was supposed to wait for my first cake, but I was too excited to try the oven out and ate the oven much sooner than recommended. The oven was delicious!</text>

Dad drove in the right lane on the freeway most of the way. When Dad wanted to pass another car, Dad used Dad turn signal to signal that Dad was going to change lanes and pass.

It started to rain and Dad used Dad windshield wipers to clear the window.</text>

    <text>I knew he was sick because he told I so. It did n't help that he was coughing and sneezing. He had n't been able to get out of bed for days. It looked like he had a fever. He had gone to the doctor a few days ago. He had a prescription from them, but he was n't able to take the medicine he. He needed a prescription from them. I went to the cupboard we kept a prescription from them in and took out the medicine. A prescription from them was in a small bottle. The medicine was liquid, so the medicine was easy to administer.

    <text>The grass on the backyard's lawn was beginning to get tall and thick, so before The grass on our front lawn grew any higher, I thought The grass on our front lawn would be a good idea to cut The grass on our front lawn. I decided to pull out our lawnmower from the shed in our backyard. There are several kinds of lawnmowers, but the kind of lawnmower our own in gas-powered. Because our lawnmower had no gas in The lawnmower's motor, I pulled a gas storage container off of a high shelf in our backyard shed and filled the gas tank. To start The lawnmower's motor, I pulled the starting cable vigorously a few times. The lawnmower's motor roared to loud life and I began pushing The lawnmower's motor through the grass in the yard in a methodical back-and-forth pattern so The grass on our front lawn would be evenly and neatly cut. The lawnmower's motor made our front yard look so good, I decided to mow the backyard's lawn as well!</text>

    <text>As the cashier was preparing breakfast, the cashier noticed that the cashier was out of a lot of things that are staples in the preparation of most other dishes. Bread, milk, and things of that nature. So after the cashier was done with breakfast, the cashier sat down to prepare a grocery shopping list. The cashier thought of all the things off the top of the cashier head that the cashier would need, and then the cashier perused through the cashier cupboards and refrigerator to fill in the blanks. Once the cashier was satisfied with a grocery shopping list, the cashier got dressed and got in the cashier car. The cashier drove to the grocery store and parked. The cashier grabbed a cart and pulled a grocery shopping list out of the cashier purse. The cashier went up and down the aisles, placing things in a cart as the cashier went. Once the cashier had everything, the cashier went to the checkout counter. The cashier put all my things on the belt and a bagger bagged all my things as the cashier scanned. A bagger set the bags in a cart, and the cashier took the bags out to the cashier car. Once the cashier got home, the cashier brought the bags inside and put all the groceries away. This is how the cashier went grocery shopping.</text>

    <text>The summer time dad is a great cook and one of the things the summer time dad knows how to cook good is fish. Sometimes the summer time dad buys the fish from the supermarket and sometimes the summer time dad buys the fish from the fish market. When the summer time dad buys the fish from the supermarket the summer time dad buys the fish by the pound and the fish is usually already cut up into pieces and cleaned up. When the summer time dad buys the fish from the fish market the summer time dad has to clean the fish out more and take out the bones. Some of the fish the summer time dad buys still has The head of the fish, fins and tail so the summer time dad has to cut those parts out too. The head of the fish is really good to make fish soup. My like the fish better when the summer time dad leaves the scales -LRB- skin -RRB- of the fish as the fish tastes really good. There are many different ways that the summer time dad cooks the fish. Sometimes the summer time dad will fry the fish in a pan or deep fry the fish and also put some bread crumbs on the fish before frying the fish. The summer time dad also bakes the fish in the oven which makes the fish soft and tender. My favorite is when dad steams the fish a little bit and we eat the fish semi-raw like sushi. In the summer time dad will also throw some fish on the grill and barbeque some fish. My mom told My that eating fish is really good for you as it has a lot of essentials vitamins and oils and eating fish makes you live longer and is also god for you brain.</text>

    <text>I was really hungry. I decided to make a pot of the chicken noodle soup. I had some leftover chicken in the fridge so I took some leftover chicken out and brought some leftover chicken to the chopping board. I put a pot of water on the stove to boil. After I chopped some leftover chicken, I threw some leftover chicken into the boiled water. I added a little chicken stock and seasoning. I went to the fridge and grabbed some carrots, celery and onions. I brought the veggies back to the chopping board as well. I chopped up the vegetables into small chunks. When the veggies were all cut, I threw the veggies into a pot of water. I let the vegetables cook down for a while. The chicken noodle soup was starting to smell good. When the chicken noodle soup was almost done, I threw in some noodles. In just a few minutes, the chicken noodle soup was ready to eat.

I scrubbed I body well with a washcloth, to get off all the sand and ocean salt that had dried on I skin, along with the sunscreen that I had been using. My body was very relaxing and I felt really good. I then pulled the drain on our deep soaking tub and let the nice, warm water go down.

I sat on I bunk with I notebook propped against I knees and thought about what I wanted to say. After a few minutes, I decided I knew what I wanted to say, so I picked up my pen and started moving my pen across the paper. First I put the date in the upper right hand corner. Then I wrote ``Dear Mom and Dad ''on the first line. I kept writing all the words I needed to use in order to convince my parent's to let I come home. Then I signed the letter in an envelope with I name. I folded the letter in an envelope in half and then folded the letter in an envelope in half again so that the letter in an envelope would fit in the envelope shut. Then I put the letter in an envelope. I taped the envelope shut. Then I stuck a stamp on the upper right hand corner. I wrote my parent's address on the middle of the envelope shut and then I walked to the camp office and gave the letter in an envelope to the secretary so she could mail the letter in an envelope for I.</text>

    <text>I decided to make a split pea soup for dinner, so I cleaned off a cutting board, wiped down the table, and got all of I needed ingredients ready. I grabbed several stalks of celery and a carrot, washed several stalks of celery and a carrot, and peeled a carrot with a peeler. Then, I placed a carrot on a cutting board and sliced a carrot lengthwise. After splitting a carrot, I proceeded to use I knife to chop the two sides into small half circles. Following this, I washed off the several stalks of celery I picked out, and chopped off the ends, throwing the several stalks of celery I picked out, and chopped off the ends away. I then sliced each stalk of celery lengthwise, before chopping the several stalks of celery I picked out, and chopped off the ends into smaller pieces. Finally, I picked a large potato, washed all the dirt off of it, and peeled it. I used the large knife to cut it lengthwise and then chop it into bite sized pieces for use in a split pea soup.</text>

    <text>My family had gone on vacation. We had n't all been together in a couple of years and We decided that We needed to take a photo together. We had traveled to the beach and We thought the beach who came up to us would make a wonderful backdrop for our picture. We told everyone what time We wanted to take our picture and walked down to meet at the beach who came up to us. Everyone showed up, but there was still a problem. Who was going to take our picture? Luckily, there was an older couple on the beach who came up to us. An older couple on the beach who came up to us offered to take a photo while We posed. We were so grateful. An older couple on the beach who came up to us snapped a few pictures and gave the camera back to We. We talked to an older couple on the beach who came up to us for a while and expressed We gratitude. After that, We went to a local photo shop to develop We pictures. An older couple on the beach who came up to us came out better than We thought!</text>

    <text>One morning, the coffee maker got up and the coffee maker was very tired. The coffee maker decided to make a cup of the coffee to wake the coffee maker up. Reaching in the fridge, the coffee maker pulled out the coffee, placed a filter in the coffee maker and added the water to the machine. While the coffee maker made the coffee, the coffee maker decided to pour the coffee maker a bowl of cereal. As the coffee maker ate, the aroma of the coffee filled the kitchen with a rich, earthy smell, letting the coffee maker know that the coffee maker hot drink was ready. The coffee maker quickly went to cabinet, pulled out my favorite mug, and filled my favorite mug with coffee and just a little bit of creamer and sugar. After finishing the coffee maker first cup of coffee, the coffee maker poured a second cup into a thermos that the coffee maker could take with the coffee maker to work, and finished getting ready for the day. After a little jolt of caffeine, the coffee maker was ready to take on anything the day might throw at the coffee maker!</text>

    <text>This past month, I was very busy with planning a party for my younger brother. I had to find out a number of things, but the most important one was figuring out who I could invite to the party. After I had a good enough idea, I went to the store and bought several themed party invitations. After buying several themed party invitations, I spent a long time writing names and addresses for people that I wanted to invite to the party. After finishing the writing and putting all of the invitations in envelopes, I put stamps on all of the invitations in envelopes so all of the invitations in envelopes could all be mailed out as soon as possible. I made sure that all of the invitations in envelopes had stamps and the correct addresses of the people who would be getting all of the invitations in envelopes, and put all of the invitations in envelopes in I mailbox for the postman to take all of the invitations in envelopes to the post office to be sent off. On the day of a party for my younger brother everyone I sent an invitation to came to the party, and that made I brother very happy.</text>

    <text>I always wash the dishes for I family, I think the dishes for my family a fairly fun chore, and I like the dishes for my family much better than other chores. One night, after a large family dinner, we had a lot of dishes to do. After I started washing them, I put them on the counter to dry. Because there were so many of them, I ran out of room and had to stack them one on top of the other. Well, I stacked them so high that them kept falling over. Thankfully, none of them were made of glass. But, it was really funny because no matter how hard I tried, I could not get them to stack right. Finally, I had to stop washing the dishes for my family and start drying them so I could make room for more clean dishes. I would wash a batch, then dry them, and then wash the next batch. The next batch took I almost a half hour to finish them!</text>

Then her asked I if it looked like a man I did not know yelling at a woman who lives next door had a weapon. I said I did n't think so. Her told I not to worry, but to stay inside. Then her told I the police were on the way. Her talked to I until the police arrived. Her wanted to know how old I was, and where I went to school.

    <text>One day I was strolling in the woods with I camera. My camera was a nice high quality camera with a zoom lens. My camera was beautiful, but the photographs my camera took were even more beautiful. Anyway, I was strolling through the woods with my camera. I had I camera, and I pictured a good shot. I then took I camera out and aimed my camera. I aimed well, and I captured the best photograph that anyone has ever taken. Or at least, in I opinion anyways. Well, back to the photograph. It was taken of a scene in the woods, one of those dark, forested scenes that makes you dread you own existence. Your own existence was of a large tree, next to another tree, next to another tree, in the forest. There was a beam of light casting through the frame. A beam of light casting through the frame was exhilarating. I can still see the photo now, burning a hole in I mind's eye. What a day.</text>

    <text>I just got out of bed and am having a very hard time focusing. I feel like I can barely function. Then it hits I, I am in desperate need of caffein. I walk into the kitchen. I open the cabinet and take out a can of coffee. The cabinet is a new can so I have to open with the can opener. I line the basket with a disposable paper liner for easier clean up. Next I get a spoon out of the drawer and measure out a large scoop of coffee and add to the filter basket. Just the smell is helping I to wake up. I measure out two more scoops of coffee. I then put the filter into the coffee maker. I then take the carafe and fill with water. This is then poured into the coffee maker. I hit the on button and wait a couple of minutes. Then I pour the hot coffee into a mug and start to feel better.</text>

    <text>After taking a two week trip to Europe I arrived home with lots of laundry. I decided that I should start washing my clothes the night I arrived home. I did three loads of laundry but I was so tired that I tossed all of my clothes onto the couch without folding all of the clothes. I woke the next morning feeling a bit refreshed and decided that is was time to tackle the pile of clothing on the couch. First I separated my clothes into heaps based on clothing type and then I began folding all of the items. I used to work in a clothing store so I began folding I clothes very precisely. I folded everything neatly and made piles based on how my clothes would be stores in my closet.

    <text>Yesterday I decided to boil my sterilized milk so I could make cottage cheese. The first thing I did was select a pan to boil my sterilized milk. I decided to choose the widest pan I had, because the widest pan I had would let I boil my sterilized milk more quickly. It is important to select the widest pan I had, a narrow pan will take longer for my sterilized milk to come to a boil and will increase the risk of burning my sterilized milk on the bottom of the widest pan I had. Once I selected the widest pan I had, I poured my sterilized milk into the widest pan I had, and turned the heat on the stove top to medium high heat. For the next ten minutes, I constantly stirred my sterilized milk heated, to evenly distribute heat and to reduce the risk of the milk burning in the widest pan I had. After ten minutes of heating, my sterilized milk came to a boil, so I removed the widest pan I had from the heat, ready to use my sterilized milk to make cottage cheese.</text>

The garlic chive cream cheese on my onion bagels's the perfect combo. I crack the eggs into a bowl and whisk a bowl up to make some scrambled eggs. But I need to cook the bacon on the plate first. I cook the bacon on the plate until golden brown and crispy. I pan is full of oil and butter. I am going to scramble the eggs in that. It will be deliciously decadent. I scramble the eggs in rendered fat and butter mix until the eggs're almost done. Then I put the eggs and the bacon on the plate. Along with the bagel with cream cheese slathered all over cheese. Cheese's time to eat. I need a dollop of pico de gallo for the eggs. Perfect.</text>

    <text>My friends and My love to go to the movie theater. Every Tuesday, the movie theaters have cheap days, where you can go see the real movie, and then buy a drink and small snack for $5 too. So, we check online to see when the movies are playing, and we decide what we will see. Then, once we do that, we all go in the car and drive to the theater right before the real movie begins. We park, and get out and stand in line for our own tickets. We usually all buy our own tickets, and then go in and order a drink and snack. After that, we all go into the theater, and take we seats. The real movie always has previews before the real movie begins, so we have time to talk a little before the real movie starts. The real movie also gives you time, if you were running late, to get there so you do n't miss the real movie. We have a great time.</text>

    <text>I needed to put wall paper on the walls of I room. My room to look tidy and fresh was in dire need of The old wall paper. The old wall paper was looking bad. I asked I friend Ryan to help I put the new wall paper up. My friend Ryan was a painter and regularly did this kind of work. I first removed The old wall paper from the walls of my room with my friend Ryan. We then got the new wall paper and applied the new wall paper to the walls. The new wall paper required We to brush down the new wall paper so the new wall paper would stick. We checked to make sure everything was even. I did not want uneven wall paper. After We applied the first sheet We started applying the other ones. We checked to make sure the new sheets were even as We went. Finally after applying the new sheets We cut the new wall paper away. I wanted I room to look tidy and fresh. Overall my room to look tidy and fresh was fun putting up new wall paper with I friend.</text>

    <text>I emptied out the little bit of coffee that was still in the pot from yesterday and rinsed the pot out. I turned on I water filter and started filling the pot to the line that shows ``6 ''. I dumped my water filter into the water reservoir of the coffee maker. I carefully removed my water filter with the used coffee grounds from the day before out of the coffee maker and threw my water filter in the trash can. I got a new filter out of the bag that I keep in a cupboard above the coffee maker and put my water filter into the basket. I measured six tablespoons of the coffee into my water filter and closed the basket. I turned the coffee maker on and waited for the basket to brew. When the coffee was brewed I poured some into a mug, added a few spoonfuls of sugar and some creamer which I stirred and was ready to drink.</text>

    <text>It was a sad day. June's great Aunt Martha had died a few days ago, and today was the day they would have June's great Aunt Martha funeral. Everyone in June's family was dressed nicely, and made there way across town to the funeral home where the service would be held. As the entered the room, there was a strong smell of flowers that made June's nose ache a little. June's great Aunt Martha mom signed a book with June's great Aunt Martha and June's great Aunt Martha brothers names, and her and her brothers made there way into a parlor where other people had gathered. At the front of the room was a casket that was half way opened with Aunt Martha's body lying in Aunt Martha's body. June's family made there way up to the front of the room to look at June's great Aunt Martha. June's great Aunt Martha looked as if June's great Aunt Martha was taking a nap in June's great Aunt Martha finest clothes. June's great Aunt Martha make up and hair did n't really look like June's great Aunt Martha used to wear them, but June's great Aunt Martha did n't look scary like June's had imagined. Them met some family members that were sad and crying, but others were laughing and remembering funny stories about June's great Aunt Martha. Them made there way to a seat at the back of a parlor where other people had gathered and a few songs were played while the curtains were drawn in the front of the room. When the curtains opened back up, Aunt Martha's casket in the back was closed with a large spray of flowers on top. A pastor stood up and said some really nice things about June's great Aunt Martha, and prayed. The curtains closed again and A pastor told the crowd that her funeral would resume at Shady Oak Cemetery. Afterwards, the group of people that had gathered made there ways to their car for the funeral procession to the cemetery. June's family followed a long line of cars following a hearse with June's great Aunt Martha casket in the back. A police man escorted the group of cars, and stopped traffic so the funeral procession to the cemetery did n't have to stop at red lights on the way to the cemetery. As the pallbearers pulled up to the gravesite, June's saw a green tent with lots of folding chairs underneath, and a metal frame around a hole in the ground. June's family gathered around a green tent as the pallbearers carried June's great Aunt Martha casket to the gravesite and placed Aunt Martha's casket in the back on the frame over a hole in the ground. A pastor said a few brief words and prayer again, and then June's great Aunt Martha casket was lowered into the ground. June's family talked a little while, and then drove over to June's great Aunt Martha house to have a wake. There June's family ate food prepared by a local church for June's family, and talked about the good times June's family had with Aunt Martha when June's great Aunt Martha was alive.</text>

I get my non-stick pan from the cabinet and a silicone spatula. I place a little butter in my non-stick pan and turn the stove on medium heat. As my non-stick pan begins to heat, I crack my eggs, add a little milk and mix thoroughly. I think my non-stick pan is ready and pour my eggs in while moving my eggs slowly with a silicone spatula.

I do n't like my eggs too runny. I can now slide my eggs off onto I plate and turn off the stove. I have a nutritious meal in minutes.</text>

    <text>Last night I invited some friends over for dinner. I decided to set the dining room table for dinner, rather than have us all eat around the coffee table in the living room like I partner and I usually do. First, I chose the tablecloth. We have a purple tablecloth, a light blue snowflake patterned tablecloth, and a bright colored floral tablecloth. I chose the floral one because I felt it was most appropriate for summertime. Next, I put a cloth napkin at each place and set utensils on top of a cloth napkin - a knife, fork, and spoon. Then I placed a plate at each setting, four in total. I added a water glass at each setting as well. Then I put out the salt and pepper in the middle of the dining room table for dinner so the salt was accessible to everyone. Lastly, I lit two candles and placed two candles in the center of the dining room table for dinner as well. The dining room table for dinner looked great and ready for a dinner party.</text>

    <text>Last weekend, my friend and my decided it would be a good time to paper our living room. The previous residents of the house our live in had used wallpaper on the living room walls that was a very odd shade of red, which our thought looked strange. Our wanted our living room to get a new color of the yellow wallpaper, and our wanted to choose a color that would match our personality. Our first went to Sherwin-Williams, which is a paint and wallpaper store. Our looked at the wallpaper color samples and picked up a few brochures with examples of how the wallpaper color samples would look on our walls. Our decided that a cheery yellow color would look best on our walls, and selected that color. Our then returned to Sherwin-Williams and purchased the yellow wallpaper. Our then applied the yellow wallpaper to our walls and stood back to admire our work.</text>

    <text>I'm in charge of preparing the picnic as we head to the lake. I have a lot of supplies I need to gather first. I need to fold up the waterproof tarp for the ground or picnic tables. I need a blanket that can double as a tablecloth. I'll be sure to pack that on top so we pull that on top out first. I need to pack forks, spoons, knives, napkins, cups, paper towels, a couple of garbage bags and few zip top backs for leftovers. I'll make a shooter sandwich with meat and cheese. Since a shooter sandwich's smashed, a shooter sandwich will travel well and a shooter sandwich can be cut up in advance. I'll also pack the potato salad in a container, some chips, and pretzels. Maybe some Boursin dip for both. I will also pack some pre-made sangria and lemon water in spill-proof bottles. I think chocolate chip cookies are great picnics too. Chocolate chip cookies can go in a container so chocolate chip cookies do n't get crushed. We should have all we need.</text>

    <text>We have a large yard, a half acre on a corner lot. Due to the size, We have a ride-on mower which makes cutting the grass relatively easy, I would even say ``fun. '' Thanks to a lot of experience, I can get that thing moving and get the yard done in just a little under an hour. It's normal, average, boring. Except this one time.... A cousin had taken We ride-on mower to do some maintenance on a ride-on mower which makes cutting the grass relatively easy. A cousin had taken a ride-on mower which makes cutting the grass relatively easy on a Friday evening and had promised a ride-on mower which makes cutting the grass relatively easy would be back by Sunday evening. A cousin was wrong. Sunday and Monday came and went with no sign of We lawn mower. Tuesday evening came and the grass was up to your ankles. The grass needed to be cut. We had bought a small push mower to get into the small spaces so We pulled a small push mower out. I, I wife and I mother-in-law took turns pushing that mower up and down the yard for a good two hours. We had one tiny little bit left of the yard when Howard, A cousin, pulled up with a small push mower.</text>

    <text>When you work in a restaurant, after the customers have paid the bill and left, you have to clean up the restaurants table and prepare the bill for the next customer. Sometimes the bill can be very easy if the bill was only one person, but if the bill was a large family the bill could be very messy. All the left over plates, cups and utensils need to be cleared away to the kitchen to be washed. The table top will also need to be wiped down of any food or spills, so it is fresh and clean for the next diners. And if there are placemats the next diners too will need replacing. My favorite placemats are the ones you can color in, especially when the next diners leave crayons on the restaurants table to use. Once the new place mats are down, a whole new table setting can be done. Often restaurants and cafes will have a special way restaurants and cafes like restaurants and cafes tables to be set up and restaurants and cafes up to the wait staff to make sure that restaurants and cafes done that way for every table. Restaurants and cafes may involve fancy folded napkins, or how the glasses or utensils get lined up. Some times restaurants and cafes involves a whole new setting of plates, utensils and glasses and other times the restaurants table is bare except for the salt and pepper shakers. But regardless of what the restaurants table set up may look like, the restaurants table has to be ready so new customers can come in and enjoy new customers meal.</text>

    <text>It has been raining a lot and the lawn has been growing. So I mowed the lawn this morning. I had to go to the gas station to get some more gas to put into the lawn mower. Fortunately I lawn is small. But to I the lawn is a hassle to have to mow the lawn. Sometimes I mow the lawn once a week. Anyhow, I put some more gas into the lawn mower, but some more gas would not start. I think some more gas needed some more oil. I but a bit of oil in and some more gas started right up. I mowed in rows as I usually do. There were several sticks on the ground I had to pick up. I do n't like mowing over sticks. There was a turtle hiding in the bushes while I was mowing.

My mom always buys tickets ahead of time to make sure we all have tickets since The theater is a little distance away. Once we all are at The theater we all pick up we all pre ordered tickets. We all then head to the snack line. While waiting in the line we all all decide what snacks we all want. My love to get popcorn with lots of butter, a pickle and a large Dr. Pepper. After we all get we all snacks we all head to the theater to watch the movie. Once inside, we all pick out what seats we all would like. We all do n't want to be too close or too far, the middle is the perfect spot. Once we all get settled the movie starts. Everyone is quietly watching the movie until the movie is over.

    <text>I enjoy drinking tea. I made tea just this morning as a pleasant start to I day. I filled I kettle up with the water and put my kettle on the stove. I turned the heat all the way up so that the water would get hot quickly. When my kettle started to whistle, that let I know the water was hot. I poured the water into a mug, being very careful not to burn I. I scooped out some tea leaves into a little tea infuser, which I put in I mug. After several minutes, I felt like some tea was probably strong enough to start drinking. I like to add a little honey to I tea to make some tea sweet. After I finished I cup of tea, there was enough hot water to make more! I poured water into a thermos, added more tea to the tea infuser, and sealed tea up tight so that I'd have some nice strong tea ready to drink when I got to work.</text>

    <text>Every week I go to the store to stock up on groceries for I family. First, I make a plan for the meals I want to make during the week. Then, I look through the cupboards and refrigerator and freezer to see what I already have. If I need something to make a meal and I do n't have a meal already on hand, I put a meal on I list. After I do this, I then check I pantry for staples. I like to always have certain things on hand like ketchup or vegetable oil. I also check to make sure we do n't need any paper products like toilet paper or paper towel. If I find anything that we need, it goes on my list. Once I list is complete, I get in the car and drive to the store. I make sure to mark off each item as I put each item in the cart so I do n't miss anything.</text>

    <text>I went to the Dallas Museum of Art yesterday. It was so much fun. I took I friend Becky. My friend Becky loves art. When we got there we bought we tickets. I liked the big entrance with all types of art all around. First we went to the painting area. There were all the paintings. We could have spent the whole day looking at all the paintings and talking about all the paintings. One painting had a lady in front of a house. One painting looked simple, but I friend Becky explained One painting to I. One painting had meanings or symbolism in One painting. My friend Becky said One painting was like a story looking at a lady in front of a house facial expression and how my friend Becky house looked. Next we went to look at the sculptures. There were very old ones and some modern ones as well. I think I liked all the paintings better. I liked the colors of One painting.</text>

    <text>This morning I woke to find I needed to do laundry. The first thing I did was divide The light clothes in to piles, based on how I would wash The light clothes. The light clothes were in one pile. Dark and heavy clothes were in another. The light clothes, that I would also add bleach to, were in a third. The light clothes were put aside. I loaded the first set of clothes in to the washer, the white. I picked up the bottle of laundry soap and filled the cap up all the way. I poured the cap over The light clothes in the washer. I poured a bit of bleach in as well, to make sure all the stains came out. Once all the stains were ready, I turned the dial on the machine. I made sure it was washing on warm and the dial read ``whites ''. I waited for all the stains to finish and put the in the dryer. Once I had I did the same thing over again, only not using bleach, for the other piles of clothes.</text>

    <text>I went out to eat at a restaurant last weekend with my husband. We went to a place that is pretty popular in town and has gotten really good reviews. We had to wait a few minutes for a table, but soon enough We were seated. A restaurant had a warm and friendly feel, and We waiter appeared right after We were seated. She was warm and friendly too. She greeted We and asked for We drink orders. My husband just wanted water, but I got an unsweet tea with lemon. We chose not to order an appetizer, but the waitress brought We drinks and a basket of rolls for We to snack on. We ordered We entrees then, having had time to study the menu. My husband got a steak and baked potato with a side of steamed broccoli and I ordered the salmon and wild rice. We waitress took the order, then promised to have We food out soon. We sampled the bread while the waitress was gone. The rolls were delicious and the tea was refreshing. We began talking about how We days had been and discussing moving, which We are in the middle of currently. We talked for a few minutes until We food arrived, then settled down to eat. I had only taken a bite of my fish, however, when I realized that something was wrong. The smell was off and The smell had a bad taste. I thought The smell must be bad. I waited until We waitress was coming back by, then I asked the waitress if the waitress would take it back and bring I something different, because I felt like the salmon was going bad. The waitress agreed and I ordered a steak like my husband got. My husband said my husband was delicious. The waitress took my fish and apologized profusely. The waitress brought I steak out very shortly and a steak was fantastic. The waitress kept checking on We throughout the meal, and the manager even came over to offer We a free dessert. The manager apologized for the salmon and said that the cook had made a mistake and pulled from the stock that was about to be thrown away. We accepted the free dessert, New York-style cheesecake. The free dessert, New York-style cheesecake was so creamy and sweet. We enjoyed We meal, overall. We waitress brought We out ticket and even marked down We meal.

When Mike's got to the dentist office, they were all nice to Mike's. Mike's had to go sit in a dentist chair, and lean back for the lady to check his teeth. Then the lady started to clean his teeth with a little machine and a little stick. The machine made a whirring sound, but The machine was just water in The machine, and The machine washed Mike's clean mouth out when the lady finished. The lady then rubbed his teeth with a buffer, that made his teeth shine. A buffer, that made his teeth shine tasted like bubble gum. Mike's liked that part. Then the dentist came in and examined Mike's clean mouth, to make sure the lady cleaned them well. Mike's was also checking for cavities. Mike's had no cavities that day, and the dentist was happy with Mike's clean mouth. Mike's gave Mike's a bag of things to take home, a new toothbrush, toothpaste, and floss.</text>

    <text>I always want to cook and finally I did it last night. I chose to have an egg-drop soup since an egg-drop soup should be easy to do and great to taste. I prepared all ingredients: two scrambled eggs on a bowl, one teaspoon of corn starch mixed with water, a handful of chopped green onion, one teaspoon of sesame oil, a half teaspoon of salt, a teaspoon of soy sauce. I placed them in sequence of cooking order so I could just keep pouring them into the pot without messing up orders. Darn, I missed the most important item - boiling water. With water started boiling in the pot, I began putting ingredients in as plan. An egg-drop soup finished good, but still seemed to be missing something. Oh, an egg-drop soup was the white pepper power and black vinegar. An egg-drop soup was not too late to add them in. With the final touch, an egg-drop soup tasted much better.

    <text>If there's one cleaning task I used to put off the most, one cleaning task I used to put off the most was definitely cleaning the homemade shower cleaner. I mixed up a batch of the homemade shower cleaner and sprayed a batch of the homemade shower cleaner liberally I bathroom shower, which needed some serious help at the time. The homemade shower cleaner consist of a spray bottle, 1 cup of dawn dishwasher liquid and 1 cup of vinegar and regular water. After I sprayed I homemade solution around the homemade shower cleaner I let my homemade solution sit for around an hour. After an hour, I grabbed a scrubbing brush and began to scrub away all the mildew stains that were in the homemade shower cleaner. I find it best that you have the bathroom well-ventilated when you start scrubbing because you do n't want to inhale all those nasty chemicals when you scrubbing away at the homemade shower cleaner. After I finished scrubbing away all the shower gunk I turned on the homemade shower cleaner and let all the dirty water and cleaning agents flow into the shower drain.</text>

    <text>I decided to go camping tomorrow night. To prepare, we needed to get some supplies. We took our sleeping bags from the closet, and put our sleeping bags in the trunk of the car. We packed a bag with food; snacks like pretzels, canned beans and corn, sandwiches, fruit and some water. We carried blankets, our flashlights, hats and gloves to the car, and packed a separate bag with clothes and extra shoes. We made sure that we had a map that would direct we to the campsite, and extra batteries for our flashlights. We were only staying one night, but had to make sure we were prepared for cold weather and had enough food. When the car was packed, we went to the gas station to put extra gas in we car to make sure we would have enough to get to and from the campsite the next day. We would sleep that night, and tomorrow morning would pack we pillows, tooth brushes and toothpaste, get dressed and get in the car to drive to the campsite.</text>

    <text>Billy decided Billy wanted to hang his new painting of a locomotive he's wanted for a long time, Billy had the perfect spot picked, right above the cat tree in the corner of his bedroom. Billy held the picture in place up to the wall finding the perfect spot picked and marked the center of the perfect spot picked with a pencil so Billy knew where Billy should go. Billy then went to Billy hallway closet where Billy had a small dresser where Billy kept Billy tools and Billy picked up a hammer, a nail, and a level. Billy then gently tapped Billy into the wall with Billy angled upwards a little to help hold the picture in place with a hammer being careful not to tap Billy in to the wall too far as it would've been hard for Billy to pull out. Billy then hung the picture in place on Billy and used a level on the bottom of the picture in place so Billy could make sure the picture in place was straight on the wall. Billy then stood back and admired his new painting of a locomotive he's wanted for a long time.</text>

    <text>An unfortunate truth of life is that some day we all die. Sadly, I lost my grandmother's a couple weeks ago. My grandmother's was in poor health for the past eight years due to a stroke, and a second major stroke several weeks prior to my grandmother's death left my grandmother's completely incapacitated. A second major stroke several weeks prior to her death was a long distance to get to Wisconsin, so I flew out from New York the day before the wake. All my family was there, including I aunts, uncles, cousins, and parents. The wake was sad, but my family put together photos and a video from my grandmother's life, and we talked about the good times we remembered. The following morning, we attended the funeral, where I uncle gave a eulogy, the pastor gave a sermon, and we sang some of grandma's favorite hymns. We then drove in a procession, or long line of cars, to the graveyard, where we said we final goodbyes and cried. Funerals are always sad, but we get to reminisce on memories of good times with we departed loved ones.</text>

Beth and Tim have two children, and when Beth and Tim get home at that night from work, Beth and Tim usually start by getting out the pots and pans to cook with. Beth and Tim look into their refrigerator, and see what Beth and Tim have to cook that night. That night Beth and Tim picked out steak, some vegetables, and some bread to make a dinner. Beth and Tim put all the food onto the counter, and started to wash some vegetables first. Then Beth and Tim cut up some vegetables to make a salad. Beth and Tim put a salad to the side, and made sure that Beth and Tim had some salad dressing in their refrigerator, so that Beth and Tim could use that for the salad. Beth and Tim put salt, pepper and some steak sauce on the steak for seasoning. Next, Beth and Tim heated up the oven, and put the steaks into the oven on high heat.

I called 911 as fast as I could. Luckily for us, the fire department is only a mile away and Those guys were there in just 3-4 minutes. Those guys were awesome. Those guys put out the fire so fast and ran in the house without thinking about risking Those guys own lives or limbs. Those guys got the house out and only caused a minor amount of damage to the other rooms in the house. The kitchen will need some work but the kitchen could have been so much worse.

Her father helped Tanya pick some of Tanya favorite drawings, and put some of her favorite drawings in beautiful frames from the store. Her father had little frames and all her frames, and Tanya put in different pictures in each one. Then her father took a painting in the frame on the back, and a hook, and pushed a hook in the wall. A painting screwed in easily, and her father made sure that a painting was against the wall, and then her father hung the frame on the back on a hook. Her father made sure that a hook was latched onto the frame on the back, and that a hook was hanging straight. Her father hung all her frames up with all Tanya pictures that way.

    <text>My shower was filthy and grimy. Whoa! All that shower dirt had to go. So what My did was, My went over to My local Walmart, and My bought the dousing wet sponge cleaner. My gathered those things and bought those things all, and all cost My 9.89 in total, including tax for these shower cleaning supplies. My headed back home, filled a bucket up with two gallons of hot water, and added two tablespoons of bleach and about a quarter cup of shower cleaner. After that My put on some rubber gloves onto My hands in order to protect some rubber gloves from the harsh chemicals. My then put the dousing wet sponge deep into the bucket cleaning solution, and then proceeded to scrub My shower with the dousing wet sponge. My rubbed out all of the grime out of the shower with the wet, chemically treated sponge. After My completed the scrub down, the scrub was time to rinse, so My simply ran the shower head with lukewarm water in order to drain all the grime down the shower drain. After that, My shower was finally clean, grime free and looked like new!</text>

    <text>We made We selection at the steakhouse, slowly sipping We wine to kill the time when the waitress arrived with salads and soon after the entrees. I picked up I knife and began to cut only to realize that my steak to be rare was medium. I was so disappointed. I had specifically made the point that I wanted my steak to be rare. I had a moment's hesitation wondering if I should send a moment's hesitation back. I remembered I days working in a restaurant and all things that happen to food that was sent back but in the end, I decided to be very polite and the waitress if she would indeed take my steak to be rare back to kitchen knowing they would have to start over.

    <text>My wife and I decided to have a picnic with my sister and brother-in-law. We picked out a park to go to because a picnic with my sister and brother-in-law had a pavilion We could sit under to enjoy the weather. My wife and I planned to make a salad that had avocado and peppers in a picnic with my sister and brother-in-law. My sister said that my sister would bring pizza and a dessert.

We put a salad that had avocado and peppers in it in a bowl and took a salad that had avocado and peppers in it with We as We drove to the park. We found the place to eat and waited for my sister and brother-in-law to arrive. After about ten minutes, they showed up with the food and the tablecloth.

    <text>This Morning I was alone in I house. I was at upstairs bedroom. I was reading news paper. Suddenly, I heard a doorbell. I was not sure who a doorbell was. I went down the stairs. Then I went towards the door. I looked through the door hole to see who is at the door. It is very important to check who is outside before opening the door. What I saw through the door hole was that the door hole was courier delivery guy. The courier guy seemed authentic. So I unlocked the door and rotated the door knob to open the door. The courier guy greeted I, and asked I to sign on a paper before receiving I courier. This is done to make sure the correct person for whom the parcel was intended only gets the parcel. So I signed a paper, took the parcel. The courier guy smiled at I, I said bye to The courier guy and then I closed the door and locked the door again.</text>

    <text>I was thirsty so I decided to make a cup of the tea. I looked through I box of teas and rifled through the assorted flavors. I settled on Earl Gray, which is a black tea flavored with bergamot orange. I filled the kettle with water and placed the kettle on the stove, turning on the burner so that the kettle would heat up and begin boiling. In the meantime, I got out a teacup and saucer, and then removed the teabag's from the package and placed the teabag's into the empty cup. After a time, the water on the stove began boiling, so I removed the teabag's from the stove top and poured a cup-size amount into a teacup. The water on the stove filled the empty cup, covering the teabag's, soaking the empty cup. I removed a spoon from the drawer and placed a spoon in the empty cup, stirring gently as the contents of the teabag's were released and began to color the water on the stove a light brown. After some more stirring, the teabag's contents were entirely released and the tea was ready to drink.</text>

My first task was finding a day that would work and trying to be discrete about My first task.

After establishing all of these details, I planned a party for her and sent invites, planned the food, and planned some gifts. This experience was good, but was somewhat difficult.

    <text>I really wanted a painting for my hall bathroom. I decided to order a painting of I girls in the bathtub in black and white print. It took a lot of convincing for my husband to hang the painting. My husband to hang the painting first took out the stud finder and tape measure. My husband to hang the painting always wants tape measure to be perfect. My husband to hang the painting found the center of the wall and the stud. My husband to hang the painting then took out my husband to hang the painting drill and drilled the screw in the wall.

    <text>After my kids went to bed tonight, my looked in my kids playroom and noticed that the had left toys out. My did not want anyone to walk through the room and trip on any of the toys that had been left out. My decided to clean up the toys that had been left out.

After that, my saw that there were a lot of Legos that were left out of the Lego container.

The last thing my did was clean up a few Barbie dolls that had not been put away either. Once their playroom was clean, my went to sleep.</text>

    <text>On a hot summer day nothing is better then going to a swimming pool. There is one at the community center by us so us can walk there. Before us go, us get into us bathing suits and put on us flip flops. Us make sure to pack snacks, and towels and drinks into a bag, and grab a float and the ball for a while to play with. Us walk to the pool, the hot day making us even more excited to going swimming. Once there, us hurry to find empty lounge chairs to put us towels on and waste no time getting into the pool. The water feels so cold at first, but The water so refreshing. Us swim around and realize us have friends there. Us play a game with the ball for a while before getting out for snacks. Us dry out in the sun while us eat and drink and when us are hot again us get back into the water to swim some more. Going to the swimming pool on hot days is the best way to stay cool and have fun too.</text>

    <text>Today I wanted to read the newspaper, but I do not have a newspaper subscription. I decided that the best way to get the newspaper would be to go to the library and read the newspaper there. I got dressed, put on I bike helmet, and biked over to the local public library. There, I went in and asked the library clerk where the daily newspapers were located. She directed I to the third floor, where all of the periodicals and newspapers were kept. I thanked She and went up the stairs to the third floor, seeing the newspapers held on large wooden sticks. I found the newspaper I wanted, the New York Times, and took the New York Times over to a large empty reading table. There, I scrolled through the pages that interested I, mainly the sports and politics sections, before returning the newspaper, exiting the library, and riding home on I bike.</text>

    <text>Last weekend I woke up in a bad mood. I went to make some coffee to wake I up. I ground up some coffee to wake me up. The coffee grinder was loud and woke up I wife. My wife asked I to make my wife some coffee too! I had to grind up some more beans. I put some filtered water in a microwave safe container. I put a microwave safe container into our microwave, which was three years old! I had to heat up the water for six minutes because our microwave, which was three years old is not that fast. I placed a filter on top of a coffee cup for I wife. I filled a filter up with some coffee to wake me up I had ground. I tamped down the coffee grounds with I hand. Then I carefully poured the hot water from our microwave, which was three years old over the coffee grounds. I allowed the water to soak into the coffee grounds, and I allowed the coffee grounds to come to rest in a filter. Then I slowly poured more of the hot water into the coffee grounds.

    <text>My wife and My have been married for over 50 years and we are n't quite as athletic as we used to be. About once a month, however, My wife and My get bored and decide to do something we've been doing together since we met 50 long years ago. My dress up in one of My nicer suits and she puts on a dress in which she looks absolutely beautiful. We belong to a club that holds dance lessons every week so we sign up in advance and make we way there. Once we arrive we greet all of we old friends and get a short lesson on what we're to be learning that evening. Then, for about an hour or so, My wife and My dance with each other and some of we friends. We try to keep up with all the steps, but we old joints soon make we aware of we age. Even still, My would never give up the opportunity to dance.</text>

    <text>My friends and My wanted to make a camping trip. We first had to decide where to go. We picked a national park not very far away. We had to call and speak to the park ranger and arrange a spot to set up camp.Once We did, We began to plan the rest. We had to make sure We had the right equipment. We purchased a tent that was big enough for all of We and enough sleeping bags to sleep We all. We took some cast iron skillets from the kitchen, so We could cook with some cast iron skillets. We also bought enough food. We bought food that would not go bad if enough food was not in a fridge. We bought lots of canned food. We also bought bottled water, enough to last a camping trip. We paced the clothes We would wear. We also packed all We gear. When We were sure We were ready, We headed out to the woods to go camping.</text>

Just this morning, the first thing me did after waking up was feed him. My cat usually always has a way to tell me that him's hungry. If him does n't jump onto me bead and brush up against me head, him'll meow very loudly while standing next to the pantry, where me keep the cans of food. Once me see that him's hungry and trying to tell me, me go over to the pantry and grab a can of cat food. Me use a can opener to crack a open, and then me pour a into him bowl. Me'll then watch him as him eats. Him never leaves a single piece of food in him bowl, and always licks it clean.</text>

    <text>Last night, I booked my ticket to Boston. I got on the computer and found the next available train and purchased my ticket. I packed I bag and printed I purchase confirmation. This morning, I headed to the train station. I handed I receipt to the clerk and he handed I my ticket. I train was scheduled to depart at 8:00 AM. I checked my watch and saw my watch was 7:35 AM. I quickly headed to the gate where I train was. I approached the gate and handed my ticket over. I was easily able to board the next available train. I found I seat towards the back of the next available train. I was happy to have a window seat so I could view the scenery during the trip. I set my luggage aside and settled into I seat. The steward came over and asked if I wanted a beverage. I said I would like a water. She quickly returned with I drink. Shortly after, the next available train departed. I was impressed with the scenery during the trip. I also chatted with a few other passengers and enjoyed a quick nap during the trip. After about two hours, the next available train arrived at the next available train destination. I gathered my luggage and got off the next available train. I had arrived in Boston.</text>

    <text>On a bright, sunny Monday morning I put on some light clothes and headed outside to mow I lawn. I opened the garage door, put on I sunglasses, and grabbed a bottle of cold water. I gassed up the lawn mower with I portable gas tank. I pushed the lawn mower into the yard where I normally started to mow. I cranked to mower, and on the third try the lawn mower started. I pushed the lawn mower back and forth throughout the yard, creating straight and conformed lines. Once I had completely mowed the front of the yard, I turned the lawn mower off and took long drinks of cold water. I then pushed the lawn mower to the backyard and started the lawn mower up again. Making straight lines in the grass, I completed the backyard, as well. As I turned I mower off, a neighbor who was passing by waved and gave I a smile. I smiled back and continued to clean up and put I mower away.</text>

    <text>Today I woke up and decided to make the bacon and eggs for breakfast. I walked to the kitchen and got out all of the ingredient I needed, which included, eggs, the bacon, cheese, onion, and green pepper. I placed a skillet on the burner to heat up, and cracked two eggs into a bowl. I threw away the shells and stirred the shells up until mixed. I also put the bacon in the frying pan and flipped each piece after several minutes. Once the bacon was cooked, I poured the veggies and egg mixture into the frying pan, stirring occasionally, until egg mixture set up and was solid. Once cooked, I removed two eggs and placed two eggs on a plate along with the bacon. I put a plate along with the bacon on the table and poured out a glass of orange juice to go with I meal. I also peeled an orange and set an orange on a plate along with the bacon. An orange was delicious!</text>

I walk into the store and the way the store is laid out I can easily find the items that I need pretty quickly, grocery shopping is not I favorite past time, I go to the deli counter and get lunch meat for help yourself nights and school lunches. I then head to the meat department to get some chicken and a roast for Sunday. Now time for the isles and I coupon matches, I head down each isle relativity quickly since I already know pretty much what I am going to buy and how much of each isle relativity I need. I finish each isle and have all of I necessities. I go over to the bakery to see what they have on sale Today and see a large carrot roll with cream cheese filling. So I place that in I cart and head for the checkout isle. I place all I purchases on the belt near the cashier and watch as each one is scanned, She totals I purchase and I pay for them. As I leave the store I look at my watch and realize my watch took I much less time as usual. Now I can enjoy the rest of I day!</text>

    <text>Just recently, the light in my hallway went out, and since my younger brother is afraid of sleeping in the dark, this became an unnecessary problem. In order to calm my younger brother down, my dad went to the nearest hardware store to buy a brand new light bulb. My younger brother needed to make sure that a brand new light bulb was the right size, so my younger brother took the old, burned out light bulb with my younger brother to compare. After finding a brand new light bulb, my younger brother paid for a brand new light bulb and brought a brand new light bulb back home. My younger brother then grabbed a nearby chair so that my younger brother could stand on to reach the empty socket where a brand new light bulb would go. My younger brother had my turn off the light switch, which would make sure that my younger brother would not get electrocuted while putting a brand new light bulb on or burned when a brand new light bulb turns on. After less than 5 minutes, my younger brother is finished screwing in a brand new light bulb. We flip the light switch, which would make sure to see if the light switch, which would make sure works, and the light switch, which would make sure does. My younger brother was now relieved.</text>
