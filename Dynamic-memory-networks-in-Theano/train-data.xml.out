    <text>I went into I bedroom and flipped the light switch. Oh, I see that the ceiling lamp is not turning on. The ceiling lamp must be that the old light bulb needs replacement. I go through I closet and find a new light bulb that will fit the ceiling lamp and place the ceiling lamp in I pocket. I also get I stepladder and place my stepladder under the ceiling lamp. I make sure the light switch is in the off position. I climb up the ladder and unscrew the old light bulb. I place the old light bulb and take out the new one. I then screw in the old light bulb. I climb down my stepladder and place my stepladder back into my closet. I then throw out the old light bulb into the recycling bin. I go back to I bedroom and turn on the light switch. I am happy to see that there is again light in I room.</text>

    <text>The weather was so nice today that I decided to have a barbecue. I called up some of I friends to invite some of my friends over. I set up some chairs and tables outside for I friends to sit around. I then took out some hot dogs from I fridge and brought some hot dogs over to I barbecue. I barbecue is a gas barbecue, so all I had to do was press the knob and turn a barbecue to ignite a barbecue. Once I got a little fire going I put some hot dogs on the grill over a little fire to cook. I closed the lid and left some hot dogs to cook for about ten minutes. After ten minutes I decided to check on them to see if them were done. Them looked like them were cooked, so I put them all on a plate to serve to I friends. I went to I kitchen and got hot dog buns, ketchup, mustard, and relish to serve on top of some hot dogs. I laid out all of the food and condiments on the table so I friends could help my friends. We ate some hot dogs and relaxed around the table.</text>

    <text>On Sunday mornings, our paper boy usually has the paper delivered by 7 AM. Our paper boy rides our paper boy bike through the neighborhood and tosses the papers on everyone's yards before most anyone gets up. When I wake up on Sunday mornings, I put on I robe and put on I slippers. I walk down the stairs and go to the door. I unlock the stairs and go outside to look for I paper. I walk down the steps and I see the stairs on the lawn, carefully wrapped in the plastic, protecting the stairs from the weather. I grab the paper delivered by 7 AM and pull the paper delivered by 7 AM out of the plastic as I walk back up the steps and go back into I house. I throw away the plastic and sit at the table while I coffee brews. I scan over the paper looking at the different articles, focusing on one in particular about a local political debate.</text>

    <text>Last time I had to paint a wall was when I bought a new house. Although a new house was new to I, a new house was a fixer upper house. As a result, a new house had a lot of quirks and one of which was the painting on a wall. A new house was not updated and did not look great. As a result, I felt that I needed to redo the paint job. In doing so, I decided to get paint that was interesting to I and after purchasing the paint job, I completed the paint job by I. The paint job was a great experience and I enjoyed painting and using primer and such and I felt that I did a great job at completing this task by I.

    <text>Today we decided to paint the extra room in we house. Were going to have visitor coming next month so hopefully the painting ai n't that smelly anymore. I made sure that the wall is clean and clear of all the nuisance. We already bought the new wall pain and we decided the new wall pain is sky blue. I husband is putting the newspaper on the floor to avoid any spill on we floor/carpet. We put tarp on the floor to avoid any spill on our floor/carpet too before we put the newspaper. I finally start painting and it was so easy because we made sure that everything was ready before we started. It did n't take we 30 minutes to finish the whole job. We leave everything in the room except the paints, brush and other stuff that we used. We will be cleaning and removing the newspapers and tarp once the wall paint is dry. The wall paint was fun afternoon working together and we both love the result.</text>

    <text>It was early in the morning around 4 AM. I was laying in bed when I heard my baby boy crying in my baby boy room. I knew my baby boy was hungry. At only five months old, my baby boy had quite the appetite. I picked my baby boy up and we walked into the kitchen. I took out a bottle and added formula to a bottle. Then, I added some water and put a bottle into a pot of water on the stove. I lit the stove and waited for some water to boil so the stove would make the milk warm for I baby. After several minute, a bottle was just right. I put a nipple on a bottle and tested the temperature on I wrist to make sure the milk was n't too hot. I sat down in the rocking chair, holding my son. I rocked my son and put the bottle in my son mouth. My son quickly drank my son bottle. When my son was finished I put my son on I shoulder and burped my son. My son belly was nice and full and now my son was ready to go back to bed.</text>

    <text>Yesterday I had a barbecue. Before we could start a barbecue, I had to prepare the food we had bought to eat. I chopped all the vegetables and seasoned them. I got all the meat and cut all the meat into the right sizes then seasoned them as well. To start a barbecue, I placed charcoal and lighter fluid on a grill. While a barbecue was heating up, I made sure that all the food was ready to be cooked. I also made sure there were enough condiments, like ketchup and mustard. As I cooked the people I had invited began coming in. I put ice in a cooler, then added cans of soda and bottles of water, to make sure there was enough to drink. By now, a barbecue was heated enough to cook on. I placed all the meat on a grill and watched all the meat as all the meat cooked on one side. After a few minutes I switched sides until all the meat was cooked fully. I cooked the vegetables, they did not take as long. Once all the meat was ready I sat all the food out for I friends to eat. I was very enjoyable.</text>

    <text>I picked up a dozen eggs in a carton while I was at the grocery store. When I got home, I took two out before putting a carton into the refrigerator. I took a frying pan from the cabinet and put a tablespoon of the butter into the cabinet so a dozen eggs would not stick. I cracked a dozen eggs open on the edge of a bowl one at a time, and put a dozen eggs into a bowl one. I threw away the shells. I added a little bit of salt and pepper. I used a whisk to break the egg yolks and mix the egg yolks and the whites together. Once the whites were combined, I turned the heat of my stove on to medium. I let the butter melt and then I added a dozen eggs. After the whites started to cook, I used I whisk to move the whites around so that I got scrambled eggs instead of an omelet. A dozen eggs got nice and fluffy. Once the whites were fully cooked, I took a frying pan off the heat of my stove and turned off my stove. I put the whites onto a plate and enjoyed the whites with some toast.</text>

Jenny gathered up the mail that Jenny had been saving for the last few weeks and thumbed through the pile. There they were, those dreaded bills that take most of Jenny paycheck. There was a car payment, and a mortgage payment, and the power bill for the month. Jenny got her check book out of Jenny purse. Most of her friends pay her friends bills online, but Jenny still liked doing it the old fashioned way. Jenny got her check book out of the drawer along with Jenny pen. Jenny opened each bill and noted how much each bill would cost to pay each one. Jenny would have to wait to pay the mortgage next pay day, but Jenny had enough to pay the power bill for the month, and car payment. The power bill for the month was one hundred and fifty-seven dollar and thirty-nine cents. Jenny wrote the check to the power company, placed the check in an envelope along with the payment stub. Jenny sealed an envelope along with the payment stub and addressed an envelope along with the payment stub, placing a stamp on the right corner. Jenny did the same procedure with Jenny three hundred dollar car payment. After an envelope along with the payment stub were ready, Jenny placed an envelope along with the payment stub in Jenny mailbox for the mail carrier to take. Jenny took her checkbook and wrote the amount Jenny had spent on the ledger. Then Jenny subtracted her checkbook from the amount of money Jenny had to see how much would be left until next pay day. Jenny would have to be very careful with Jenny money this week, but Jenny should have enough to get by.</text>

    <text>Last night, I took a bath. I take baths when I have time to relax and soak in the bubbles. Baths are important for good hygiene and self esteem. I always feel so much better when I am clean and smell like I favorite soap. I like to fill the tub up as full as I can and pick a shower gel or bubble bath to make lots and lots of bubbles. I just soak in the bubbles and enjoy the time to I. Then I wash I hair with shampoo and conditioner. Next, I make sure to scrub everywhere from between I toes to behind I ears with soap. After that, I am ready to dry off and get into some clean clothes. If I do n't have time for a bath, I just take a shower. Showers are much faster! No matter what I choose, I make sure to take a bath or a shower every day.</text>

    <text>This morning I decided to make an omelette. I took the eggs out of the fridge and cracked three of the eggs into a large mixing bowl. I added a small amount of milk to make the eggs fluffy. After the eggs warmed up, I dumped the eggs into a greased pan. I cooked the eggs on low so the eggs would not stick. I then started cutting some cheese into small pieces. Once they were halfway done, I flipped the eggs. I sprinkled I freshly cut cheese on top of the eggs, and then folded the entire thing in half using a spatula. Once one side of an omelette was done, I flipped an omelette to the other side with a spatula again. I repeated flipping the eggs until I could see that some cheese was melted. I put the eggs on a plate and poured a glass of milk to go with some cheese. I sat down and enjoyed I breakfast.</text>

I put a spoonful of the pulled pork in a skillet, and added a spoonful of the baked beans. The fried zucchini looked good too, so I put some of that in a skillet also. I put a cover on The fried zucchini so the food would heat up faster and more evenly. Before I turned on the burner, I checked to make sure the pilot light was burning. The food was, so I turned the knob to start the gas flame under a skillet. I did n't want to burn the food, so I set the gas flame on low and stayed by the gas stove to check on the gas flame.

    <text>I love going grocery shopping! I have a very specific way that I approach a very specific way and I do the same thing each week. On Tuesdays, the grocery ads come out for the week. I look through the grocery ads and make a list of what is on sale. I meal plan around those things. Once I have a list of what I will be cooking, I write those ingredients down along with all of the other things I want or need. I separate those ingredients by department. I put all of the dairy items together, then the meat items, followed by the produce, and so on. This makes This more efficient when I am pushing a cart through the store. Once I'm at the store, I select I items quickly. I usually buy the same brands and often the same items each week, so I know where everything is. When I'm ready, I go to the checkout and put it all on the belt so I can pay for the belt. I love grocery shopping but I hate to put grocery shopping all away when I get home!</text>

    <text>My neighbors went out of town for a week for a vacation, and My neighbors asked My to help take care of My neighbors pet fish.

    <text>Today when I woke up, I realized I had a lot of dirty clothes. I gathered up all the dirty clothes I could find. I put all the dirty clothes I could find in a basket, then I brought a basket into the laundry room. I set a basket down and I started to sort through all the dirty clothes I could find. I divided all the dirty clothes I could find by color and I decided to wash the whites first. I threw all the dirty clothes I could find into the washing machine and measured out a scoop of the detergent. I added the detergent to the washing machine and closed the door. Then I set the settings on the knob to whites. All I had to do now I press the start button. I pushed the start button and all the dirty clothes I could find started to wash. The start button took a while, but once all the dirty clothes I could find were clean, the washer stopped running and beeped. Now I was ready to dry them!</text>

    <text>I got home from the grocery store and had bought many different kinds of vegetables, both for I to eat as well as for I guinea pig. I decided to chop all of the vegetables so I could just pull all of the vegetables out and eat all of the vegetables during the week without having to take the time to prepare all of the vegetables. I put a cutting board on the counter and pulled out a sharp knife. I started by cutting up green peppers, I cut the top off and removed the seeds and cut the pepper into strips. Next I cut up cucumber, I washed the pepper and sliced the pepper into thin round slices. I chopped the bottom off of a bunch of celery and cut each stalk into four inch long pieces so I could dip four inch long pieces in peanut butter. The next vegetable I chopped was broccoli which I carefully cut florets off of the head. I was going to make soup so I chopped an onion but cutting the top and bottom off, removing the peel and cutting an onion into small squares. All of the vegetables were put into separate plastic containers and put into the fridge.</text>

It is important to get the corners clean so I started at the outside of the room and swept toward the center. Then the room was time to wash my floor. When I was little, I mother told I, ``Clean corners, clean floor, ''and I can hear her voice as I fill the bucket and add a little bit of cleaner to the warm water. Next I got down on I hands and knees and washed my floor with the warm, soapy water. I followed this with a rinse using only clean water. When this was done this looked so nice and I knew there were no spills from cooking anymore.

    <text>It was time for a new flooring. Our carpeting had been worn and old, so Our decided to go to laminate floors. Our measured the size of the room to get the area and Our ordered a new flooring at the lumber yard. They called Our when a new flooring was in and Our brought a new flooring back home. The cartons of flooring were heavy. Our also needed to purchase rolls of the underlay. Our tore the carpet up and threw the carpet out. Then Our lay down the underlay mats. The carpet was hard work and Our sweat a lot. After just laying down the underlay, Our took a short break. Then a short break was time to put down the laminate. A short break was hard to lock the pieces together, but a short break came out nicely. Our were proud of the hard work Our did.

    <text>I am getting ready for vacation to the beach so I need to pack my suitcase. I start by putting my shoes into plastic bags and sitting my shoes in the bottom of my suitcase. I then packed shorts by folding my shoes and putting my shoes in a pile on top my shoes. I shirts and sundresses I folded into thirds lengthwise and rolled my shoes up like a sleeping bag; by packing my shoes this way my shoes will not get wrinkled as easily and it is easy to fit more into my suitcase. I matched swimsuit tops &amp; bottoms and folded my shoes together. I put all of I toiletries like shampoo, sunscreen and toothbrush into a plastic bag in case my shoes would leak and into a special toiletry bag and put that in the top of my suitcase. I added two beach towels to the very top to cover everything in my suitcase. I easily closed and zipped my suitcase and was ready to go.</text>

The traffic was simply too horrible. The day though, We had a plan, We drove We car to a stop-and-park place and from there We caught a subway train into the city. We walked all over the National Mall area of the city.

    <text>Today was the big day, I was going to visit some friends in Florida, but I was going to do it in a different way. I was going to ride a train Today for the first time ever. I loved trains since I was a child and now I would finally get to ride on one and see the countryside. I bought I tickets online, I did n't want to make a mistake and got to the wrong station. I had I bags all packed so I called for a cab and headed to the train station. Once there I took my luggage with I and waited for my train to pull up to the station. Once my train to pull up to the station was here I boarded and found an open car. I set my luggage in the overhead compartment and sat and waited I ticket was checked before my train to pull up to the station left the station. My train to pull up to the station finally pulled out of the station, I was on I way I dream was being realized.</text>

    <text>Today I went to the dentist. I walked through the dental office doors and noticed a giant play room full of really neat toys. I sat and played until a giant play room full of really neat toys was time for I appointment. I liked the building blocks the best. Then the lady at the desk called I name and showed I to a big comfy chair. There were all sorts of different things in a giant play room full of really neat toys. Shiny things, pictures of white teeth, and machines. Then the dentist came in with a big smile and I knew we were going to get along just fine. The dentist cleaned white teeth and said that I had been brushing really well. The dentist told I that candy can hurt teeth sometimes, but eating lots of healthy foods help teeth to be strong like the ones on the poster on the wall. After we were done cleaning white teeth, the lady at the desk smiled at I and gave I some toothpaste and a little box of floss. Then we went home. I love the dentist!</text>

    <text>It was such a nice day for a picnic. I decided I'd take the kids to the park for lunch. I pulled out the cooler that I keep in the closet and filled the cooler with a bit of ice. I put a few drinks and bottles of water in the ice to keep the cooler cold. Then, I moved on to the actual food. Sandwiches seemed like the easiest food to make, so I pulled out the bread. The kids and I all like ham, so I made three ham and cheese sandwiches and wrapped three ham and cheese sandwiches in sandwich bags. I packed a reusable container with some cut melon we had the night before and grabbed a couple bags of individually sized potato chips. I threw all the food in a reusable container and grabbed a roll a paper towels. When I told the kids where we were going, the kids were so exited!</text>

I went to an online website for the airline to book my flight that left tomorrow. I chose a window seat so I could enjoy the scenery on my flight that left tomorrow. After booking my flight that left tomorrow I packed my suitcase with what I would need for my flight that left tomorrow. The very next day I woke up and got dressed. I wore loose fitting clothes that would be comfortable on the flights. I wore shoes that I could take off easily to get through security and a belt with no metal in a belt, again so I could get through security easier. I went to the airport with my suitcase and went to the ticket counter. I gave them I ID card and them printed I ticket for I. I gave them my suitcase and them tagged my suitcase for I and gave I a baggage claim ticket. I then went through security. After making my suitcase through security I went to I gate and waited until I was told my suitcase was time to board the plane. I got on the plane in I window seat.

    <text>I decided this morning to take a shower. I walked into the bathroom and shut the door. I turned on the fan since the bathroom gets very steamy when I take a shower. I turned The warm water on and made the temperature just perfect. The warm water had to warm up, so I stood patiently while The warm water did. I placed I towel on the counter and got into a shower. I shampooed I hair thoroughly and used conditioner on my hair afterwards. Then, I took my soap and washed I body thoroughly. I rinsed off my soap, and then I grabbed I facial scrub. I used my facial scrub on I face and made sure my facial scrub was very clean. After that, I turned The warm water up a bit so The warm water would be nice and warm. I stood in The warm water for a few minutes relaxing. When The warm water started to get slightly cold, I turned off a shower and got out. I used I towel to get dry and got dressed. My towel was a very good shower.</text>

    <text>One day, I decided to redecorate my daughter's bedroom. My daughter's has a small bedroom, so we needed to do some creative things to fit into that small space. First, I drew my daughter's room and where all the furniture was. There was a twin bed in the corner, a dresser beside a twin bed in the corner, a colorful rug in the middle of her floor, a desk with my daughter's computer and school stuff on a colorful rug in the middle of her floor, a bookshelf, and lots of pictures on the walls. Then, I drew my daughter's room and what I wanted my daughter's bedroom to look like when I was finished decorating. I drew the new bunk bed with my daughter's bed on the top bunk and storage space underneath against the far wall, her dresser next to the window, the rug in the middle of her floor, my daughter's bookshelf where it was before, and newly painted walls with my daughter's favorite pictures hanging on the walls. I removed the furniture and pictures and belongs. I covered her floor with plastic, so the paint would n't get on the paint. I painted the walls pink. I let the paint dry. I placed a new rainbow-colored rug in the middle of my daughter's bedroom, assembled the new bunk bed, and put her dresser and bookshelf and belongings back in my daughter's room. My daughter's loved my daughter's new room.</text>

    <text>I learned how to iron yesterday. After doing the laundry, I noticed how wrinkled the clothes were. I mom showed I that every piece of clothing has a tag with special instructions. Most of special instructions tell you about the washer and dryer, but some of special instructions say not to iron, so watch out! First, we got out the ironing board and put the shirt around around the ironing board. We put water in the iron and plugged the iron in, waiting for the iron to heat up. Then, we carefully laid the iron on the shirt around and moved the iron around. The wrinkles just disappear. We had to move the shirt around to get The wrinkles in different parts. After that, we just had to do the same process on the rest of the laundry. Some clothing needs to be steamed instead. There is a button on the iron that lets out hot steam, like a trigger. Its important to have the iron set on the right settings for every piece of clothing you need.</text>

    <text>The other day, my wife and my decided that we needed to put some new hardwood floor in we house. We planned out what kind of wood we were going to buy and decided to go to the hardware store to ask for some help. A worker there suggested that we get rosewood flooring and so we decided to shop in that store for other tools we might need, such as hammers. We bought the old wood at a lumber store and took the old wood back to we house. Over the course of a few days, we took out the old wood. We hit the old wood with hammers and broke the old wood to pieces. We threw hammers away. Than we placed the old wood down and began to put the old wood in.

    <text>Me and a friend recently papered a room. A room was slightly large and a room took us a little longer to do than previously expected. Us first looked at some online sites for the best brands and colors. Afterwards us waited to get the packages. The paper was a nice blue color. Us started at about ten in the morning. Us set this time and day because this time was us day off and us could spare the hours needed to complete the task. This time took us about three hours to complete. Us started from the top of the walls and worked us way to the bottoms. As us worked there was a sense of accomplishment and us believed a room was coming together quite nicely. Me felt us also enjoyed spending the time together doing something productive. A room looked brand new whenever us completed a room. Us were very pleased with us work and us.</text>

    <text>I saw a sign on the street for an upcoming performance at the local theater. A sign looked interesting so I decided to attend a show. Usually the audience at a theater is dressed nice even though there is not dress code. Because of this I was sure to wear nicer clothes the evening of a show and made sure I hair looked good. A show began at 7:30 pm so I arrived at 7:30 pm so that I had enough time to buy a ticket and find I seat. The stagehand dimmed the lights so I knew that a show was about to begin. The curtain went up and I sat back and enjoyed a show. During the right moments, I clapped to show I appreciation. After a show my favorite actor took a final bow and I cheered some more. Before I left, I had I favorite actor sign I program so that I had a memorable souvenir.</text>

    <text>First, if the alarm clock has a cord, I unplug the alarm clock from the wall. Then I find the battery cover opening - this will usually be on the bottom or back of the alarm clock but could be on the sides also. The battery cover opening is usually like a compartment with a tab that I can push on to release the battery cover to expose the old batteries. Once I see the old batteries, I determine if I have replacement batteries or not. If I do n't, I might run to the store or order the old batteries on line if I am not in a hurry to replace the old batteries. Once I have the old batteries, I remove the old batteries by either pushing against one end so the other end presses down on a spring and I can pull one end out, or sometimes there is a ribbon underneath the old batteries that I can pull to release the old batteries. I check carefully which way the old batteries go, making sure the plus sign on the battery -LRB- the knob end -RRB- goes towards the plus sign on the clock battery compartment. Once the old batteries are in, I make sure the alarm clock is on -LRB- plugging the alarm clock in if needed -RRB- then I use the time buttons to set the correct time, making sure if there is a morning/night -LRB- a.m. / p.m. -RRB- indicator, I have the alarm clock set correctly. Finally, I use the clock buttons to set the alarm time -LRB- again making sure the a.m. / p.m. indicator is correct -RRB- and turn on the alarm by setting the switch to ``alarm ''or`` radio''.</text>

When the dentist for my semi annual cleaning came to review my teeth, the dentist for my semi annual cleaning said my teeth were healthy but I need to make sure I floss regularly. The dentist for my semi annual cleaning said I should floss at least once a day. I agreed that I need to be better about flossing.

    <text>My daughter and My wanted to watch a movie after dinner, but there was nothing good on TV. We decided to go and rent a movie. We drove to a nearby store that had a movie rental box. We looked through all of the movies that were available. Some of the movies that were available were funny, some had a lot of action, and some were scary. My daughter and My finally decided that We wanted to watch a comedy movie. My daughter and I selected a movie that had recently been in the theaters. The price to rent a movie that had recently been in the theaters appeared on the screen. My put My bank card in the slot and entered My PIN number. The machine recorded the information, then told My to remove My card. My took My card and receipt. The movie DVD came out of The machine. My daughter picked up a movie that had recently been in the theaters from The machine and We went home.</text>

    <text>Every Monday and Thursday I wash my daughters' clothes. I usually have 3 batches of clothes to wash. First I fold my daughters' clothes from the previous wash because they normally stay in the basket until the previous wash's time to wash again. Once my daughters' clothes are all folded and picked up. I take the dirty clothes basket from my daughters' bathroom and wash the first batch of clothes which includes I and my daughters' clothes. I run the water and add the detergent. I then put my daughters' clothes in the washer adding more detergent and close the lid. Once they are done, I take they out and put they in the dryer on to dry. I then turn the dryer on to dry on. I then start running the water in the washer adding more detergent again, adding more detergent. I then go get the dirty clothes basket from my daughters' bathroom. I bring the dirty clothes basket to the laundry room and add their clothes in the washer adding more detergent. Once the dryer on to dry is done with I and my daughters' clothes. I take they out, hanging up the things that need to be hung and putting the rest in the dirty clothes basket. I take my daughters' clothes out of the washer and put my daughters' in the dryer on to dry. Turning the dryer on to dry my daughters'. I then run the water again in the washer adding more detergent. I go collect all the towels in the house, my daughters' bathroom and the kitchen usually. I add all those towels in the washer adding more detergent. Once the dryer on to dry is done with my daughters' clothes, I take my daughters' clothes out and put my daughters' clothes in the dirty clothes basket. I then put all those towels in the washer in the dryer on to dry. Usually it stays this way until I need to wash again on either Monday or Thursday!</text>

    <text>I was having a date night with my boyfriend and we could not decide what we wanted to do. Neither of we wanted to spend a lot of money, so we thought it would be a good idea to rent a movie. I used I cell phone to look up the nearest Redbox, and we drove together to the Redbox location to pick out we film. As soon as we got to the Redbox, we started scrolling through the movies that it had available. I did n't want to watch a horror movie and my boyfriend did n't want to watch an action movie, so we decided to pick a drama film instead. We settled on a movie that had just recently won an Oscar for Best Picture that neither of we had seen yet. We paid for the Redbox using I credit card and drove back home. As soon as we got home, we made some popcorn and started a movie. Unfortunately, neither of we enjoyed our film and thought our film was n't worth all of the hype we had heard. Even though we did n't like a movie, we enjoyed we night in with each other.</text>

    <text>We went to smoky mountain for spring break. We were amazed to see the beauty of this breathtaking place. I wanted to capture these memories. So I got my latest model canon camera out. My latest model canon camera had very high resolution, and had special effects, and HD feature. I chose the good back ground, where river stream were running by the mountain, and fall was on the top, where some people were to jump in. The area was clear. First one, I did was, I told them to stand under the fall, so them did, and I took picture from top of the side road. Then next one I did was whole long view of mountains with river, s it seem like it is somewhere in deep mountain. I edited them after I capture them, and added special affects to make it more enhanced and natural. The pictures looked more prettier than real place.</text>

    <text>I opened up the cabinet and got a couple of cleaning rags and the disinfecting cleaner out and set cleaning rags on the floor of the bathroom so cleaning rags would be handy. I sprayed the cleaner on the bathtub, the tile walls around the tile, the toilet and the sink, making sure I also sprayed the handles of the faucet. With a little of the cleanser on a rag I started by wiping down the area around the light switches and the door handles. Then I closed the drain for the bathtub, the tile and ran in a little hot water. With a rag I used a little hot water and cleanser to clean the ring off from around the tub and go around the edges to get all the soap build up off. I wiped a rag up the cleaner on the bathtub, the tile walls several times to get all the soap build up off of the cleaner on the bathtub, the tile walls, too. Then I drained the tub and used more hot water to rinse the tub and walls with a rag. I did the same with the sink, and then the top and back of the toilet. I used the toilet brush to do the inside of the toilet and around the seat and underneath and then flushed the inside of the toilet and around the seat and underneath all away. The floor of the bathroom was tile, so I used a mop with a special disinfecting wipe on the head to go over a special disinfecting. As a finishing touch, I use a little glass cleaner and polish all the faucets, and clean off the mirror.</text>

    <text>A few weeks ago I decided that it was time for I to get a hair cut. Normally it is recommended to get a hair cut every six months, but I had gone quite a bit longer. The ends of a hair were splitting, and I bangs were getting longer than I liked The ends of my hair to be. I decided to go back to Great Clips, which is a chain that has a location near where I live. The ends of my hair do not require an appointment, although you can check-in online ahead of time, so I decided to walk in. I drove to the location and found a parking place easily, and there was only one or two other customers there at the time. I walked in and gave I name, and only one or two other customers had a record of what I had done at I previous visits. The woman who took I name and I told her that I wanted a shampoo and a hair cut. Her said that her could start right away and led I to a section where I could leave I phone and wallet. I put those down, and followed her over to the chair for a shampoo. A shampoo was very relaxing and did not take much time. We then went back to her section and her asked what I wanted done. I explained I just wanted about an inch taken off of most of a hair, but I bangs to be cut so they were more above I eyes again. We did n't really talk much while her was cutting a hair, and a hair took her less than ten minutes. I did not want I hair blow dried, so her left my hair blow wet. I went back to the front of the shop with her to pay, and I also made sure to leave her a tip. I left the shop with her and was very pleased with a hair cut.</text>

    <text>I decided that wanted to take a trip for I vacation this year. After deciding my starting destination, I realized that I would have to travel by airplane. Because my starting destination was so many miles away, air travel was the only practical way to go. I opened up I laptop so that I could look up the phone number of the travel agent's. I found the name and phone number of the travel agent's in I area. I called the travel agent's on the phone. The travel agent's asked I questions about the dates of the trip I wanted to take, where I wanted to go, and information about my starting destination. In a few moments, the travel agent's offered I some choices about flights I could take, and accepted I payment information. The travel agent's also told I many details about my starting destination, and advised I about some items that I should pack, and which items I should not take with I. I paid for I flight reservation and the small fee for the travel agent's services using I credit card. There were a few questions about I payment details. I tickets are electronic, and arrived in I email immediately. The whole process took less than fifteen minutes to complete. The whole process was easy to do.</text>

    <text>I'm hungry, so I'm going to make a big pot of Soup for I dinner. The first thing I do is get out my ingredients. Soup can be made with a lot of different ingredients, but I'm going to make a simple vegetable and chicken noodle soup tonight. Once I get out my vegetables, I chop my vegetables and put my vegetables into a big pot to cook. It's important to cook your vegetables first, so your can get the best smells and flavors out of my vegetables. Once my vegetables're cooked, I add broth wait for broth wait to boil before I add the rest of my ingredients. When the broth for too long, because the food inside could get burned is boiling, I put in chicken and noodles and let the broth for too long, because the food inside could get burned simmer. Your do n't want to boil the broth for too long, because the food inside could get burned. When the food inside's done, I take a ladle and fill up a bowl with I soup. Time to eat!</text>

    <text>I opened I mail box this morning and there were lots of bills! That is all I seem to get in the mail is bills. I felt like throwing them on the ground. But if I did that I electricity might be turned off for not paying the bill. I went inside and opened all the envelopes. The electric bill was a different amount. All my bills are the same every month. This month the electric bill was much higher than I thought the electric bill should be. I thought about calling the electric company. But I remembered on day I left all the lights on at home all day while I was at work. So I figured that is why the electric bill was so much. I payed I bills online. I went to I bank account and clicked on bill pay. With a few clicks all I bills were paid. But now I do n't have any money.</text>

    <text>Sometimes we like to go to the park and feed the ducks. The kids like to see how close they can get to the ducks and other birds that gather at the edge of the pond. The other day we noticed that there were some pretty large fish, large enough that the ducks shyed away from them.since the ducks were on the far side of the pond we decided to feed the fish that had gathered in a small school near the park entrance. The kids sat on the grass while I took my backpack off and opened my backpack up. I took out a bag of stale bread and began breaking a bag of stale bread into small pieces and handing The kids to the kids. The kids tossed pieces in one at a time, closer and closer to the edge in an attempt to lure the fish closer to The kids. The ducks watched, enviously from across the pond. The fish eventually were basically on the sandy edge of the pond, and I youngest daughter reached out and poked one.</text>

    <text>About one time a week I change I bed sheets. First I remove the top and bottom sheet from the bed and put the top and bottom sheet from the bed where I put I dirty clothes to be washed later. Next I get the bottom sheet. I use a fitted bottom sheet. A fitted bottom sheet has elastic on the corners of the bed to kind of like hook around the corners of the bed. Sometimes getting the last corner on is hard because a fitted bottom sheet will be tight. Next I get a fitted bottom sheet. A fitted bottom sheet is the easy part. I unfold a fitted bottom sheet and spread a fitted bottom sheet over the top of the bed. Then at the foot end of the bed I push a fitted bottom sheet in between the top mattress and the box springs. And I do the same thing for the sides of a fitted bottom sheet. A fitted bottom sheet helps the sheet to stay on the bed. Then I do all this again next week.</text>

    <text>In a few weeks, places around the world will be celebrating Earth Day, a global event promoting environment protection. I will, as I do every year, meet up with some friends who live close by and spend Earth Day, a global event promoting environment protection at the park. We will have a picnic, eat some food and drink a few beers, play frisbee and toss around a football and at some point, We will plant trees off to the side of the park. We will plant these trees in an effort to promote environmental sustainability, and to do We part as one in a millions' chance to help the environment. Damage is being caused to the environment and local ecosystems at an alarming rate and We should all join together to do what We can in promoting awareness and getting the word out that We need to change We ways to help protect We environment.

    <text>I went to the beach to go swimming and started to hear someone screaming. There was a woman out in the ocean that was finding it hard to swim back to the shore when there was too many waves hitting the beach. I got out I phone and dialed the number 911. When the person on the other side answered, I told her what was happening and asked for someone who could swim out to save her if I could n't. They told I to stay calm and do n't do anything that would put I own life in too much danger. The police sirens were heard just a little bit after and They were driving fast to the beach. One police officer got out and her worked really hard to go swim out to the woman to save her. One police officer saved her from drowning out in the ocean water.</text>

    <text>Last month, I visited I relatives in Florida. I have an aunt and uncle there, as well as cousins. I had n't seen an aunt and uncle there, as well as cousins in years and usually only see an aunt and uncle there, as well as cousins at family functions. However, this year, I decided that I was going to vacation in an aunt and uncle there, as well as cousins area. As a result, I first bought plane tickets and planned I luggage and times, called out of work for the days that I vacationed, planned a rental car, and then went there. I had a great time and was able to see many family members that I had n't seen in years. It was an enjoyable experience and not only did I get to see family that I do not get to see often, but I also got to swim and experience the lovely hot weather of Florida. It was so much fun and I wanted to stay even longer. I had to fly home a week later though unfortunately.</text>

    <text>One night earlier this week I cooked a grilled salmon for dinner. I had picked a grilled salmon up on I way home from work along with some vegetables to steam cook for the meal as well. I drove home from the store and cleaned I kitchen to begin preparing the meal. I cut some vegetables to steam cook for the meal first and began steaming some vegetables to steam cook for the meal in a pot on the store. Meanwhile, I began to cut the salmon on the cutting board. Once the salmon on the cutting board was sliced into four good pieces, I started up I charcoal grill. Once the salmon on the cutting board was hot, I put a grilled salmon on the grill one slice at a time and cooked a grilled salmon until a grilled salmon was sufficiently cooked through and as done as I wanted a grilled salmon. Around the same time, some vegetables to steam cook for the meal finished cooking. I took all of the wood and put all of the wood onto a plate. Then, I took all of the wood over to the kitchen and ate at the kitchen table.</text>

    <text>To wash dishes you need two main things, dish soap and a sponge. You should moisten a sponge with water then pour a little dish soap on top. Usually soaking dishes before washing dishes is a good idea. After soaking dishes I usually wash the easy to wash dishes first leaving the other dishes to soak and hopefully clean off better. After the other dishes are done I move to the harder dishes like ones with crusty egg on the other dishes. The other dishes take a lot more scrubbing and may take a few tries to clean off. After I am done with the other dishes you put the other dishes in the separate sink to dry off. If you would like you could also take a clean dry towel to dry the other dishes. After the other dishes are dry you may leave the other dishes in the separate sink or put the other dishes back in the cabinets or wherever you keep the other dishes.</text>

    <text>I was doing some remodeling in I house and decided some remodeling in my house was time to put the old wallpaper off of the walls up in one of the bedrooms. The first thing I had to do was pull the old wallpaper off of the walls. I put newspaper down on the ground in the bedroom so that there would n't be a big mess anywhere, and began pulling. I was able to pull the old wallpaper off of the walls off in very large sheets, except for a few spots where our new paper was very sticky and stuck to the wall. I used a solution to get the remaining glue off of the walls, and waited for everything to dry so I could come back the next day and put the old wallpaper off of the walls up. The next day, I boyfriend and I worked together to peel the back off of our new paper to expose the adhesive, and our carefully pasted our new paper on the walls in the bedroom. Our used a tool to flatten out any air bubbles that we saw. A tool to flatten out any air bubbles that we saw took our four hours to wallpaper the whole room.

    <text>Sometimes, we only think about getting all we toys out and play with all our toys for as long as we can. But if we do only that, all our toys end up being all over the place, and someone might walk on all our toys, or all our toys might get lost under the bed or the couch. And next time we want to play with all our toys, we can not find all our toys. That is why after playtime is over, playtime is important to take a little bit of time to put all our toys back together, and have a space especially for all our toys. Playtime is a good occasion to see which ones are broken or need a little bit of cleaning that can be done with adults. The good part being if we take the time to clean up all our toys and put all our toys neatly together, the next time it is playtime, all our toys will all be here ready and waiting.</text>

    <text>I was very hungry and it was time for dinner. I was in the mood for fish, and decided that was what I would make. I took the fish to cook enough out from the freezer and set the fish to cook enough in the sink inside the bag to thaw to thaw. I did not want to wait a long time to eat, so I ran warm water over the frozen fish in the bag to thaw the fish to cook enough faster. After a while, the fish to cook enough was not frozen anymore and I turned warm water off. I got out a large frying pan and set a large frying pan on the stove burner, and set the heat on medium on the stove. I poured some olive oil into a large frying pan to make sure the fish to cook enough would n't stick while the fish to cook enough was cooking, and set each of the pieces of fish into a large frying pan. After waiting for the fish to cook enough, I poured lemon juice on each piece of fish to give them more flavor. The fish to cook enough was now done and I was ready to eat.</text>

    <text>We were renovating We bedroom because I felt like our bedroom little needed to be updated. So as a weekend project We decided to work on We bedroom little by little. We started with the bathroom that is part of We master suite. I husband started by removing the outdated tile and flooring in the bathroom that is part of our master suite and I choose a beautiful tile and flooring to replace the outdated tile. I then found a beautiful paint color to make the bathroom that is part of our master suite feel more open and bright. We painted the bathroom that is part of our master suite and changed the fixtures along with all the accessories. The end result was satisfying, so I tackled the whole closet and redid the whole closet. I reorganized the whole closet and added shelves. Then We started to remove the bedrooms carpet and put a new carpet; which was a task that took We two whole days. We had never installed carpet before but carpet was fun. I painted the walls to match the bathroom that is part of our master suite and added the finishing touches to the walls. I husband changed the lighting in the room and moved in all the furniture. The lighting took We five whole weekends to finish the room, but the end result was worth the room. I love I renovated bedroom. Now, I told I husband the kitchen is next.</text>

    <text>It had been awhile since the last time I had my teeth cleaned so I called the dentist office and made an appointment. I picked a day and time at the end of the month that suited I. When the day came I drove to the dentist office, making sure to arrive a little before the time of an appointment. There was quiet music playing in the waiting room; but the chairs were not very comfortable. I waited, dreading the teeth cleaning -LRB- it is never I favorite -RRB-. After about 10 minutes, a dentist assistant in a white coat came to show I to a chair. The dentist, smiling, greeted I and tipped the chair back. The dentist, smiling used a tool with a small mirror and a pick to look at my teeth. Next The dentist, smiling used a small whirring brush and water to wash and rinse I mouth. After each rinse, The dentist, smiling directed I to spit in a small sink on the side. When my teeth were finally cleaned -LRB- and tasting like metallic toothpaste -RRB-, I was released to go to the front desk, where I paid the white coated receptionist.</text>

    <text>I walked past the garbage can that was in the kitchen of the restaurant where I worked to find that the restaurant was overflowing with garbage. To make the garbage fit better, I pushed down on the trash with my other hand as I pulled the bag with a knot together with my other hand. I tied off the bag with a knot to secure the bag with a knot all. I grabbed a knot and pulled the bag with a knot of the container and handed the bag with a knot to a co-worker to dispose of. Next I had to replace the bag with a knot. I found a replacement bag in a box nearby. I took out a bag, opened a bag up, and inserted a bag into the can. I had to stick my other hand in and open up the bag with a knot more when the bag with a knot was in, because the bag with a knot was sticking to the bag with a knot. I used the excess at the top of the bag with a knot to tie the excess to the rim and and the excess was complete.</text>

My cousins, on the other hand were very nervous on a plane. I had to calm My cousins, on the other hand down. The food we received helped calm My cousins, on the other hand nerves. Eating distracted My cousins, on the other hand a little from we environment. Everything was fine until a plane started to experience a lot of the turbulence. My cousins, on the other hand started to get afraid again. In fact, the turbulence was so bad, I started to feel afraid as well. Soon, the pilot announced that there was nothing to worry about. A couple minutes later, a plane flew smoothly again. Eight hours later, we arrived at Mexico. We were not only excited to be in Mexico, but we were excited to be on solid ground again.</text>

    <text>After many weeks of waiting, it was finally time to plant our vegetables in the garden. Fortunately, it was a very nice, cool, sunny day. We grabbed a trowel, a rake and a hoe and headed into the back yard to begin the work. A rake had been a while since anyone had touched the garden plot, so a rake was full of weeds! We got to work pulling out all of the pesky grass and flowers. There were even some dandelions! -LRB- I might have blown the seeds of those back into the garden. Do n't tell anyone, please -RRB-. After the garden plot was weed-free, We turned over the soil using the rake and a hoe. Once the soil using the rake and the hoe was nice and loose, We grabbed the seedlings that We had started in the basement. The seedlings were in little containers. First We planted the tomatoes in a row, digging a little hole for each plant, tapping down the soil using the rake and the hoe, and then moving onto the next row. Next We planted the cucumbers, and finally We ended with a couple of pumpkin plants. After all of the plants were in the ground, We watered all of the plants with the hose, being careful not to drown all of the plants. I ca n't wait to see We vegetables grow!</text>

    <text>Last week I decided that I wanted to get my new haircut. I called I hairstylist and made an appointment to come in. On the day of an appointment I drove to the salon, checked in with the receptionist and sat down and looked through a magazine for a few minutes until my hairstylist came out and called I name. I followed her back to her booth where her sat I in a spinning chair in front of a mirror. Her asked I questions about how I wanted I hair cut and I explained my hair cut to her. Then her took I to another chair in front of a small sink where her washed my hair. When her was done, her wrapped my hair in a towel and took I back to the spinning chair. Her combed my hair and then began to cut my hair. Once her was done, her blow-dried my hair. I looked in a mirror and was very happy with my new haircut. I thanked her and gave her a tip, went back to the receptionist to pay for my new haircut, then went back out to I car and drove home.</text>

    <text>It was a hot summer day and I wanted to have some fun, so I friends and I decided to go swimming! We all changed into We bathing suits and got some towels, and walked down to the community pool. We put on some sunblock lotion to protect We skin. We each set We towels down on lounge chairs so We would have someplace to sit when We were n't swimming. It felt very good to jump into the cool water on such a warm day. We spent hours splashing and swimming in the pool. When We were n't swimming, We were sitting in We lounge chairs talking, laughing, and listening to music. We bought soda and ice cream from the snack stand and had a wonderful time! When the snack stand started to get close to dinner time, We dried off and wrapped We towels around We and started walking home. We were all very tired!</text>

    <text>John likes to go to the sauna and sit in the steam. John usually goes on nights after work when John needs to relax. John heads down to John gym, and works out. At the gym they have a sauna and hot tub. John is sore sometimes after John works out, or rides the bikes. So when John is finished, John goes to the steam room, which is the sauna, and sits in the steam and lets the sauna pour over John. The sauna is quiet in there and helps John relax. The sauna cleans the body of toxins as well, you sweat the body of toxins out. Then, after that John goes into the hot tub for a few minutes, to help his aching muscles. The sauna stops his aching muscles from hurting, and John sits in there for about fifteen minutes. Then John dries off, takes a shower, and puts John regular clothes back on.

    <text>I did the laundry room today. I went into the laundry room and filled the washer with clothes and water. After about 5 minutes I poured the laundry room, and closed the lid. I then pulled out the wet clothes out of the dryer, because the wet clothes were done. I then proceeded to fold I clothes; I sorted the shirts together, followed by the shirts, followed by the underwear and socks. I matched the socks and then put the socks in the sock drawer. I then hung the shirts and pants in the closet. All of that took about 10 minutes 15 minutes later, I added fabric softener to the washer and reclosed the lid. After the washing was done, I placed the wet clothes into the dryer and closed the door. I cleaned the lint filter, and started the dryer. While the wet clothes were drying, I started another load of clothes for washing.</text>

    <text>Yesterday I had to finally do I laundry. My dirty clothes had been piling up and I was running out of clean things to wear. The first thing I did was to separate all of My dirty clothes for the first load in the washing machine. I put both laundry detergent and bleach in the washing machine because the washing machine's harder to get white clothes clean again. I also wash the white clothes in hot water. After about an hour these done and ready to be put in the drier. I put My dirty clothes in the drier for about 45 minutes and then started the next load of color clothes. I used detergent again but cold water and no bleach. By the time the next load of color clothes was finished the white clothes in the drier were also ready to come out. I put the white clothes in hot water on I bed to fold and put the color clothes in the drier. That took about 45 minutes as well. After the next load of color clothes were finished I took My dirty clothes out and folded My dirty clothes or put My dirty clothes on coat hangars. The next load of color clothes took about two hours total for I to do all of I laundry for the day.</text>

The topic of We being hungry came up, and I asked him if him liked grilled cheese. Him did, so I whipped some up. We both thoroughly enjoyed them. After We ate lunch, We went into the living room. I flipped the light switch on. There was a painting I wife and I had bought, a painting was fifteen feet long and five feet tall. Because a painting was so large, a painting was also heavy. This is why a painting required Jim's help, even my wife could n't life Jim's help, even my wife properly while helping I attach the framing wire on the back to the nails on the wall to the nail on the wall.

The doorbell was loud and had a familiar ding dong sound that you could hear from everywhere in the house. I wondered who the doorbell could be. I did not have any visitors coming over, at least that I knew about. I wondered if the doorbell was a friend. Since I did not know, I went over to peek through the eye hole in the door. I could see them safely and them could n't see I through the eye hole in the door, so them did not know I was there. I did not know this person. Them were dressed up nicely in a suit and was holding some papers and a clipboard. I guessed this person was trying to selling I something. I did not have any money to buy anything, so I opened the door and told the salesman that I was not interested politely. Them smiled and said them were sorry to bother I and then left.</text>

    <text>As I was driving down the street yesterday, I happened to notice the fuel gauge in my car indicated that I needed to buy some gasoline. I knew there was a gas station with a decent price a mile down the road, so I drove straight there. I pulled into a gas station with a decent price a mile down the road, and I noticed that the outside pump was available. My car was lucky because the fuel cap for my car is on the driver's side, and I could easily pull into a gas station with a decent price a mile down the road. I parked my car next to the pump with the fuel cap for my car next to the handle. I turned off my car. Got out, and as I did, I released the gas cover via a switch under the driver seat. I pulled out I debit card, and I inserted my debit card into the payment center. I followed the instructions on the screen to enter I PIN. When the screen said ready to fuel, I removed the nozzle to it, and inserted the nozzle to it into I gas tank. I pulled and held the handle until the screen clicked off automatically, meaning that my car was now full of gas. I returned the nozzle to my car's cradle, put the fuel cap for my car back on my car, closed the gas cover via a switch click, and I got into my car and drove away.</text>

    <text>The last time that I went to a driving lesson, I felt slightly nervous before hand. Upon arriving there, I met with the instructor, who informed I that This was going to be conducting the lesson. This then sat beside I as I begun to drive the car. This then helped I and gave I pointers as I drove. This noticed everything that I did and attempted to help I. This was very nice and did n't say anything in a negative or mean way. Instead, This attempted to remain positive while helping I. This was an experience in which I had a lot of fun and also learned at the same time. This was really enjoyable and helped to make I feel more confident as a driver. Upon exiting, This told I that I did a great job and I paid and left. I felt accomplished after leaving the center.</text>

    <text>Last night, I threw pizza into the old trash can and some plates and I realized that the garbage bag current bag was starting to get full. I tried to fit some more in but upon realizing that I could n't, I decided to replace the garbage bag current bag. I pulled out the garbage bag current bag, while trying not to spill any of the old trash and had the new garbage bag into the trash. I placed the new garbage bag into the old trash can and tied the old trash. Upon tying the garbage bag current bag, I took the garbage bag current bag outside and placed the garbage bag current bag on the front lawn, where the trash people always pick the garbage bag current bag up. I then pushed the new garbage bag into the trash down so that I knew that I could fit any new trash into the garbage bag current bag and I then stopped. This experience was regular and easy and was influenced by the same routine that I always follow weekly.</text>

    <text>I had never planted a tree before, so before we planted one, I had to do a lot of research. I had to look up what kind of tree would work best in I climate. I had to see which ones needed certain levels of care, look up different tree diseases, and the prices of some trees. I had to find something that would work well in I yard. When we finally picked a perfect tree, we had to take a perfect tree home. A perfect tree was very heavy! Once we had a perfect tree home, we had to dig a very big hole. After you roll a perfect tree into a very big hole, you have to do something called facing the tree, which means you put the tree in the position you are happy with the already existing branches growing. You do n't want a huge branch going right toward you house! To make facing easier, you should fill a very big hole halfway with water before putting a perfect tree inside. After you face a perfect tree, fill in the dirt, and pat you on the back for a job well done.</text>

    <text>Last night my brothers and my all had to be in different places at different times so we were n't able to eat dinner together. My mom decided to order the pizza for us because the pizza for us was something we could grab and eat on the way. First, My mom asked we whether we'd like pizza from Pizza Hut, Papa John's or Domino's. We picked Pizza Hut. My mom called and they picked up on the second ring. The worker asked what we would like. My mom ordered two large pizzas: one plain cheese and one pepperoni. Then My mom was asked if we'd like any drinks or breadsticks to go with it. My mom said yes to breadsticks and no to the drinks. Then we were told we order would be delivered in about 30 to 45 minutes. My mom hung up and told we to get ready to go. 30 minutes later, the pizza delivery person knocked on the door. My mom answered and gave him the money for two large pizzas. My mom gave the driver $3 to keep for the driver for delivering the pizza for we. Two large pizzas were delicious!</text>

    <text>Last night I could n't sleep. I decided to make I some warm milk because it tends to make I feel sleepier. I got up out of bed and headed to the kitchen. I opened the cupboard and found a small saucepan. I went to the fridge and took out the milk I had. I measured out one cup and poured one cup in the sauce pan. I put one cup on the stove and turned one cup on to medium heat. I took out a whisk and stirred so the milk did n't burn at the bottom of the sauce pan. I kept stirring for about 5 minutes. Then, I turned off the stove and took out a cup from the cupboard. I poured the milk into one cup and sat down at the kitchen table to drink the milk. The milk was absolutely delicious! And the best part was that the best part made I fall right to sleep.</text>

    <text>Not too long ago I had to take a trip to visit my friend in a different state. I needed to make sure that I had enough clothing to last until I came home, so I packed my old, brown suitcase to take along with I. First, I took my old, brown suitcase out of the closet and set my old, brown suitcase on the bed. Then, I went back to the closet and decided which clothes I would want to take with I. I choose 5 different pairs of pants, 5 matching shirts, 5 pairs of socks, and 5 different pairs of underwear. I also picked out a couple t-shirts and I favorite belt. I took all of this clothing over to the bed and placed the items into my old, brown suitcase by one. Putting the clothes into my old, brown suitcase was a little like doing a puzzle. I had to make sure that everything I picked out would fit, so I was very careful to arrange things properly. When I had all the clothes placed into my old, brown suitcase, I shut the lid and went to get ready for a trip to visit my friend in a different state.</text>

    <text>I was finishing cleaning up the kitchen and waiting for the dishwasher to end the kitchen's cycle. When the button finally turned red and I could hear no more humming of the motor I depressed the level and opened the door to the dishwasher. I pulled out the top rack and checked the cups and glasses for cloudiness or specks of any type of food matter. Happy with the results of the dishwater I put the cups and glasses in the cabinet and went back to the dishwasher for the silverware and large utensils. I also checked the cups and glasses in the cabinet, and again was happy with the way the cups and glasses in the cabinet looked. I carried large utensils over to the drawer where I keep the cups and glasses in the cabinet and sorted the spoons from the forks and put the cups and glasses in the cabinet in their respective places. Then, back to the dishwasher. I checked the plates, bowls and pans that had been washed by the dishwasher and once pleased with their outcomes I also put their in their respective places.</text>

    <text>Last week, I played a game of tennis with I grandfather. Before beginning to play, I grabbed rackets from the closet and a bucket of balls. I put rackets in the living room and grabbed water s that I could have some while I played. I then got the key to get into the tennis courts at the condo complex. After doing this, I walked to the tennis court with I grandfather and started to play. We first just hit the ball around, then practiced serving, and finally played a game. We gave each other advice and tried to play as serious as best as We could. Each other advice was a fun experience and We both felt that We were getting a good workout, while also playing the sport well. Once We played a real game, We served the ball hard at each other and attempted to win a game. The ball was fun.</text>

    <text>I did I research and made sure that whatever tree I was planting could survive in I region, since I state can get cold. I checked to make sure it was okay to plant the tree. Since I parents were the land-owners, my parents said yes. I made sure to plant the tree far away from the house and any piper or wires. That way, when the tree grew larger, the tree would not be dangerous. I decided to plant a pine tree. A are not as messy in the fall, because a have needles that a keep instead of leaves that a shed. I bought a small sapling at a store. Growing a tree from a seed is more difficult. I dug a hole in the ground wide enough to hold the roots well and about 4 inches deep. I gently removed the tree from the tree container and placed the tree into a hole in the ground wide enough to hold the roots well and about 4 inches deep. Then, I covered a hole in the ground wide enough to hold the roots well and about 4 inches deep back up with soil and watered the tree.</text>

    <text>I was taking care of I Grandma and she asked I to make she bed for she. After I helped she get out of the bed and into she rocker, I took off the blankets that she was currently using. I fluffed the blankets up by spreading the blankets in the air and then laying the air over the top of the bed.

    <text>Some things just taste better cooked on a gas stove. One of Some things are eggs. They just cook better and taste better. First I turn on the flame by turning the dial on a gas stove. I then grab a non stick pan, preferably teflon and heat the pan on a gas stove. Then I drop in a pat of the hot butter and once the hot butter starts to sizzle, I crack an egg and drop the contents into the hot butter. Once an egg is cooked underneath, I use a spatula to flip an egg and cook the other side. I turn the gas off just before an egg is done so that the residual heat in the pan cooks an egg the rest of the way.I grab a plat and set a plat on the counter next to the stove. I pick up a non stick pan handle and slide an egg onto the plate. I double check to make sure that I turned the gas off and let the pan cool before putting the gas in the sink.</text>

    <text>I had to change the new light bulb on a light fixture on the ceiling of the den. I got my ladder from the garage and carried my ladder to the den. I made sure the light switch on the wall was in the OFF position. I set up my ladder under a light fixture on the ceiling of the den and made sure my ladder was secure. I climbed my ladder far enough up to reach the new light bulb. I unscrewed the new light bulb by turning the new light bulb to the left and removed the new light bulb from the socket. I carefully climbed down my ladder and took the new light bulb to the cupboard in the garage where I keep spare light bulbs. I chose a similar light bulb to the one I had just retrieved and took a similar light bulb to the den. I climbed up my ladder with the new light bulb and screwed a similar light bulb into the socket by turning a similar light bulb to the right. I made sure that the new light bulb was screwed in correctly. I then carefully climbed down my ladder and turned on the light switch to check to see if the new light bulb lit up. After I saw that the new light bulb worked, I closed up my ladder and carried my ladder back to the garage. I then put the new light bulb in a box to be recycled.</text>

    <text>Today, I discovered that I favorite button-down shirt was in fact missing a button. Instead of buying a new shirt, I searched for I handy sewing kit. I searched for a spindle of colored thread that closely matched the color of I shirt, a needle, and some scissors. I lined a button up with the spot a button fell off. Carefully, I pushed a needle through the fabric into one of the holes of a button, and threaded through the hole directly across from the hole I started from. I did this a few times, occasionally creating a criss-cross pattern with the other two holes in order to secure a button to the fabric. Once I felt that a button was secure enough, I tied a good knot to keep colored thread that closely matched the color of my shirt, a needle, and some scissors from unraveling. I favorite shirt was now fixed, all with just a few minutes of simple sewing.</text>

We went to a French restaurant, where I had a steak cooked medium rare, and he had a pasta with a creamy sauce and chicken. We split a creme brulee for dessert, paid the bill, left a tip for the waiter, and left. After dinner, We went to see the new Wonder Woman movie, the new Wonder Woman movie was action-packed and very exciting to watch.

    <text>My family recently made plans to go on a vacation over Christmas Day. After a few days of figuring it out, we decided that we wanted to go to Los Angeles. We wanted to go here because of the theme park Universal Studios Hollywood, and how much we love the park. Planning a vacation over Christmas Day took weeks. My parents booked a hotel room about a month in advance so that we would n't be struggling over finding a place to stay. Then, the week before leaving we home, we packed all of the clothes and toiletries that we would need for the time we would be gone. We also left we dog with a dog sitter, who would take care of them while we were gone. After all of Planning, packing, and booking, we were finally free to be on we way. We spend Christmas Day in Universal Studios enjoying the fun of the park like we wanted to.</text>

We then went outside and found a lounge chair where we placed we towels, sunglasses, and snacks.

    <text>We decided that We wanted to have a party this year for Halloween. We went to the craft store to begin We process in making them. We chose a small square paper to use for our invitation. We folded a small square paper so that a small square paper looked like a card. We picked out a standard envelope to match the length and width of a card. Next, We found some scrap booking materials to design We card. We purchased the items and left the store. We made little pumpkins from the material, cut little pumpkins out, and pasted little pumpkins on a card. In glitter and marker, We wrote, ``Happy Halloween ''on the front. On the inside of a card, We used a marker to write a message. A message indicated that the recipient of our invitation was invited to We party. They were told to RSVP if They were going to be able to make our invitation. We sealed the cards and mailed They off to We friends.</text>

    <text>My friends and My had just graduated high school and we wanted to burn all of we textbooks. We went to my dad's house that had a large firepit that we could put the fire with piece of dried grass in. We asked my dad's for permission and made sure permission was okay for we to light the fire with piece of dried grass. We made a pile of papers in a large firepit and got a match. We lit a match on the matchbox and threw a match on a pile of papers in the firepit. The fire with piece of dried grass got very, very big and we had to stand back while the fire with piece of dried grass was hot. We kept feeding the fire with piece of dried grass and even some logs. We threw we textbooks into the fire with piece of dried grass and said that we were glad to have finished high school. We got some marshmallows out with some sticks to put some marshmallows on and roasted up some marshmallows for we to eat.</text>

    <text>Sometimes, something happens that can really just ruin your day. Take, for example, going for a fun bicycle ride only to have the tire go flat! When something like this happens, something like this can seem like a big deal, but is only a small inconvenience. I do n't even know how to repair a flat bicycle tire, but I know how I could do a flat bicycle tire I. First, I would read about how to fix a flat bicycle tire and maybe look at a video from the internet. After I have learned how to repair a flat bicycle tire, I would go to the store to get some supplies. I would need the tools to fix a flat bicycle tire and a new tire or things to use for the repair. After arriving home, I would review the things I learned about how to repair the tire and I would follow the directions. Once the tire was repaired, I would test out the bicycle to make sure the tire was repaired and then I would clean up.</text>

    <text>Jim and Harry are best friends, and they love going to the park together with they moms and dads. Last week, Jim and Harry went to the park for lunch and while they were there, they moms asked for a picture. So, Jim and Harry stood together at the swing set and let a picture be taken. Jim wanted to try to take a picture with the camera on the phone. Jim mom handed Jim the phone, and Jim pushed the button that had a camera on the phone. The phone opened a camera on it in the phone, and Jim pointed a camera on it at Jim friend and snapped a picture. The phone came out a little blurry, so Jim had to do a camera on it again. The phone was very easy to do, Jim held a camera on it up one more time and snapped a picture. This time Jim held a picture steady, and a camera on it focused and was a nice shot of Jim friend Harry.</text>

    <text>Repairing a flat bike tire can be a little tiring, if you get my drift. Anyway, the last time my had to do this was when my'd apparently ran over some random, sharp piece of metal that got stuck in my front tire. My had to get some sealant and a little oil for my tire pump. My flipped by bike upside down and used a wrench to take a flat bike tire off. My have an older bike, so an older bike's easier to do an older bike this way. My deflated a flat bike tire and then my took a flat bike tire off. My removed the metal bit from a flat bike tire and the bladder. My sealed the bladder and had to wait for the bladder to cure. A flat bike tire got a little bit of repair mix too. After the various mixes dried, my inflated the bladder a bit and put both the bladder and a flat bike tire back on the wheel. This took a while, since my had to make sure that this was well within the wheel well, so that a flat bike tire would stay on. The last thing my really had to do was fully inflate the bladder and put a flat bike tire back on an older bike. The bladder took a little while to do, but the bladder was better than buying a flat bike tire.</text>

We love water, and anything beside water. While planning for trip, we were considering distance from we house, and stay in motel. These 2 things were important, because These 2 things was biggest expense in out trip. Another important thing which we were most also, what things we can do at this place. We wanted to get maximum out of out trip. We searched for deals for these specific places. We found good deals for Disneyland, Florida. It has beach, It has amusement park and It has good food and motels, so we decided to go there. Then we started to look for motels which is close to the location with average facilities, specially free breakfast deal. We wanted to make sure that we choose the days which has low rates. I think everything worked out good.</text>

I got a small foot stool so I could reach the light and then removed the old light bulb by turning the old light bulb counter clockwise from the light socket. And checked to see what watt the old light bulb was. The old light bulb was a 75 watt energy efficient bulb I could tell this buy looking at the writing on the old light bulb. I had 75 watt energy efficient bulbs stored in the kitchen pantry and I was able to get one and go back and stand on a small foot stool and turn the light bulb clock wise into the light socket.

Some of I much younger cousins were there, and Some of my much younger cousins each took the backpacks. There were Legos, Batman and Superman action figures, Power Rangers, Barbie dolls, little plastic dogs, and so much more. Legos, Batman and Superman made such a mess with full of so many different toys, and when Legos, Batman and Superman and Legos, Batman and Superman families left, the forgot all of full of so many different toys! I mom put I in charge of picking up full of so many different toys and putting Legos, Batman and Superman somewhere that I could remember for when I cousins come back. I tried I best to figure out which toys belonged to which cousin, and I put Legos, Batman and Superman in each backpack. I then put the backpacks in I hallway closet, hoping that I cousins would be back soon to pick Legos, Batman and Superman up. Within 2 days, Legos, Batman and Superman mom came back for Legos, Batman and Superman toys. I gave her each of Legos, Batman and Superman backpacks, and her told I not to worry if I mixed anything up.</text>

When me wake up feeling this, me go-to meal is usually a plate of toast with jam, and a cup of either milk or orange juice depending on what was in the fridge. Obviously, me would first make sure that we had the bread at all, and then me'd check for mold. If the bread was spoiled, me'd toss the bread in the trash and go to a nearby convenience store to buy a new loaf. The bread not, then me'd take two or four slices of bread depending on how hungry me was, and me'd put them in the toaster. Me'd set the knobs to toast the bread exactly how me like the bread, and when the bread finished, me'd spread some grape jam on them. Then, me'd pour me a glass of milk or juice and enjoy me breakfast.</text>

    <text>A few years ago I went to New York City. It's not easy to drive a car around the city, due to a car being so busy and so many people living there. The other transportation options are walking, taking the subway, bus, or taxi. We usually took the subway around, but decided to take a taxi from I hotel to see the Lion King on Broadway. I went out of my hotel to see the Lion King on Broadway and hailed a taxi by holding I hand up like you might see in the movies. A yellow taxi pulled up to stop, and I got inside. I told the driver where I needed to go, the driver where I needed to go, he started the meter, and off he started the meter, and off the driver where I needed to go, he started the meter, and off he went. The driver where I needed to go, he started the meter, and off he did n't talk much, and drove a little quickly for I liking, but I got there much sooner than the other transportation options would have taken. I paid the driver where I needed to go, he started the meter, and off he the fare on the meter, plus a little tip, and went inside to enjoy the show.</text>

    <text>I grabbed a hot dog out of the refrigerator and put the refrigerator on the plate in the sink. I then put the refrigerator in the microwave and cooked the refrigerator for 15 seconds. I pulled the plate in the sink of the microwave and carefully put a hot dog on a bun. I grabbed the ketchup and mustard from the refrigerator and put some on a hot dog. Next, I pulled a spoon from the silverware drawer and scooped a little bit of relish out of the relish jar. Then I slowly and carefully scattered a little bit of relish on top of a hot dog. I had cut up some onions earlier and decided that they would probably taste good on a little bit of relish, too, so I put they on. A hot dog looked a lot yummier now and I was getting really excited to eat a lot yummier. I took the plate in the sink and sat down. I ate a hot dog very fast, then got up and put the plate in the sink.</text>

    <text>Today I bought the flower plants for I garden. I brought the flower plants home in the trunk of I car, where the flower plants fit nicely in the plastic flats that the flower plants were in from the store. I also picked up a couple of bags of the moist soil. When I got home, I set the flower plants in the shade and set about to prepare the moist soil where I would plant the flowers. I used a shovel and plowed up the dirt a bit, then dug a small hole for each plant. I set a flower plant in each hole, added a little of the potting soil, a little water, then tamped down the soil around each plant a little so that the roots of each plant would benefit from being covered with the moist soil. It will take a few days for the flower plants to recover from the transplant into the flower plants new home, but if I continue to water the flower plants and keep animals away from the flower plants, the flower plants should do just fine.</text>

    <text>Last night I washed my hair. Before I got in my hair, I checked to make sure there was enough shampoo and conditioner. When I saw there was, I got in. I first rinsed my hair until my hair was very wet. I poured all the shampoo into I palms. I closed my eyes too, so I would not get shampoo in my eyes too. I put all the shampoo from I hands into my hair, making sure to get my hair very sudsy. I then rinsed all the shampoo out. Once all the shampoo was rinsed, I did the same thing again. Put shampoo on I hands, then I hair, then lather all the shampoo until there was a lot of suds. I rinsed my hair well, and my eyes too, just in case there was soap in them. When all the shampoo was cleaned out, I got the bottle of the conditioner. I squeezed the conditioner into I hands and put the conditioner on all of my hair. Making sure to reach the very ends. Once I had the conditioner in I rinsed the conditioner out, until there was no more conditioner in my hair. My hair looked very shiny.</text>

As the water started to fill, I closed the lid. Thirty minutes later, the wash was done and I put the wet bright clothes in the dryer. Then I put all of the white and light-colored clothes in the washing machine first. I added detergent and let the water fill detergent up. Once the bright colors were done in the dryer, I took the bright colors out and folded the bright colors neatly. When the wet bright clothes were also done in the dryer, I folded the bright colors as well and I put everything away so I could find everything later.</text>

    <text>My brother's has an ear ache and needs to take medicine so that my brother's ear gets better.

    <text>Last weekend, I went to the sauna with a friend. It had been a very tough week at work and we were both feeling pretty stressed out. We felt that going to the sauna would be the perfect way to relax and unwind. Fortunately, we live in a luxury apartment with a private sauna and pool. As residents of a luxury apartment, we get free access to the sauna any time we want! A luxury apartment's a great deal and a luxury apartment's one of the best perks of living at I apartment. So, after getting lunch on Sunday, we changed into we swimsuits and each grabbed we towels and flip-flops. We then headed to the sauna at we apartment building, and enjoyed the feeling of being in the sauna. As soon as we'd been in the sauna for twenty minutes, both of we felt the stresses of the week just melting away, which was a great feeling.</text>

I wash I face. I rinse. I like to use body wash instead of soap on my body because my body makes I skin feel less dry. So i scrub on body wash. And then I rinse. Sometimes I shave if I feel like it. I do n't use shaving cream, just conditioner because cream, just conditioner works the same. When I'm done in a shower I dry off and put on clothes after I put on lotion.

    <text>The old button fell off again! I love this shirt and I was determined to wear this shirt to the party, so I went into the laundry room and pulled out the sewing box. Reaching inside I pulled out the tools I'd need, the needle, the thread, scissors, and a new button which thankfully matched the other ones. I found a quiet corner to sit down in and settled on the ground with this shirt spread open in I lap. I studied the button for a moment, noticing that a moment had four tiny holes in the middle of a moment face. I pulled the thread through the eye of the needle, getting the thread through the first time, then knotted the other end. I carefully placed I needle on the inside of this shirt where the old button used to be and pushed the needle through the fabric, making sure the needle went through one of the old button little holes too. Pulling the thread tight I pushed the needle back through a different hole on the old button and through the fabric. Over and over I moved the needle in and out of the button holes, making a little x with the thread until a little x felt nice and thick. I pulled the needle through one last time so that the needle was on the inside of this shirt, took the needle off of the thread and knotted the thread end right next to the fabric. I gave the old button a gentle tug to make sure the old button was secure and smiled. I was going to get to wear this shirt after all.</text>

    <text>I have friends coming into town so I have to clean I house. My house includes I least favorite thing to clean: the shower. I use the comet around to clean I shower because the shower reminds I of the movie Mommy Dearest. I like to fling the comet around around like Joan Crawford while yelling the name Christina over and over. My house entertains I. First I take all of I soaps and shampoos out of the shower so nothing is in I way. Then I fling the comet around. Then I take a wet sponge and scrub the tile while mumbling about things are never clean enough and wire hangers and such. Once everything is scrubbed I turn on the shower and rinse away the comet around and dirty. Then I repeat the process over again because the process's what Joan Crawford would do. Though I doubt Joan Crawford actually did the process. The process was probably Joan Crawford maids.</text>

    <text>Sometimes I like to drink hot cocoa on a cold day. I make I with the cocoa, the sugar and add my own sugar, so the cocoa, the sugar's not too sweet. First I arrange the cocoa, the sugar, measuring spoons, and a nice cup on the counter, so everything is ready to go. Next I get out the chocolate milk, and pour a cup of the chocolate milk into a large enough pot that there's room for the milk to expand as the chocolate milk gets hot. Then I put a large enough pot on the stove and turn a large enough pot on. As the chocolate milk starts to heat, the chocolate milk expands, and rises in a large enough pot. I keep I eye on the chocolate milk, and keep stirring gently, so that the chocolate milk wo n't cook onto the pan. When I see bubbles forming around the edge of the chocolate milk I know the chocolate milk is hot enough, and turn off the stove. I measure out I cocoa and sugar, and stir them in. Then I pour the chocolate milk into a nice cup on the counter, so everything. I do that very carefully, because the chocolate milk's still very hot. For an extra treat, I float a big marshmallow on top of the chocolate milk, and watch the chocolate milk melt.</text>

    <text>Today is laundry day! I go to I room and pick up all of I clothes and put all of my clothes in the hamper. A hamper is a basket just for dirty clothes. I put in I brother's stinky socks. Then I bring the basket to a big box called the washer. I mother comes in and puts the laundry into the washer. I watch as the laundry turns and jiggles. Sometimes the laundry makes the floor feel like there is an earthquake! The washer makes swoosh sounds and I watch as the wet clothes spin around and around. Click! The washer is done washing I clothes. I mother comes back in and smiles at I, then My mother puts the wet clothes into another big box, called the dryer. Once the wet clothes are in the dryer My mother pushes a button and the dryer starts. Another big box is very loud! Another big box sounds like a herd of dinosaurs are walking across I yard. When the dryer stops, the wet clothes are dry. Mother folds the wet clothes and hands I stacks of clothes to put back into I drawers. Thank goodness I brother's socks are clean now!</text>

After placing a mug of water beneath the spout I put some tea leaves from the tea jar into the reusable cup and turned on the machine. Some tea heated up the water and poured some tea through some tea leaves. After a few minutes some tea poured into the reusable cup. While some tea was created I made the rest of my breakfast. Once some tea was finished I took the reusable cup out of the machine and put some tea leaves in the trash. Then I took the reusable cup to the table and added two spoon fulls of sugar and a splash of milk in order to make the reusable cup taste better. Then some tea was finished and I sat down for my breakfast. Some tea was a good cup of tea.</text>

    <text>I looked over at my alarm clock to see what time my alarm clock was. The hands on my alarm clock said that my alarm clock should be 7:30 at night, but my alarm clock was still the middle of the afternoon. I figured the cause of my alarm clock was either that my alarm clock was broken, incorrectly, set, or out of the old batteries. Upon inspection, I could tell that my alarm clock was n't running so I'd try changing out the old batteries. I removed the cover panel, took out the old batteries, and replaced the old batteries with fresh batteries of the same size. Then I put the battery cover back on and re-adjusted the time. I had to look at another clock in I house to see what the time was. Once my alarm clock was set, I checked back on my alarm clock in 10 minutes to see that the time was correctly moving forward. My alarm clock worked so I disposed of the old batteries and called my alarm clock a day.</text>

One of two different piles was light colored clothes, the other pile was dark colored clothes. I took the light colored clothes to the dryer to the laundry room.

After the baby's has used their pants to go to the bathroom someone must change large plastic pants and put clean ones on the baby's. The baby's will cry if the baby's or the baby's panties are not changed. The parent or the helper will gently lay the baby's on The parent back, usually on a padded table. Then the helper will take large plastic pants off the baby's. The baby's will need to be cleaned.

    <text>It's time to clean the floor in the kitchen. The very first thing we have to do is take all the furniture and free standing things out of the room. I want to run the vacuum to remove dust, dirt and if there are any particles on the floor in the kitchen. Now we have to get a bucket and fill a bucket with hot water and mix in floor detergent. You have to wet the mop. It's best to start in the corner of the room with boxing yourself in and move out so You back the wet floor out and are able to get out of the room with boxing yourself in and then have to walk across the wet floor. Start scrubbing the wet floor with the mop, always checking to be sure the mop is not getting too dirty. When You start to notice hot water on the wet floor, dip the mop in the bucket to rinse hot water and wring hot water out and repeat. As they say rinse and repeat until the wet floor is completely clean. It should n't take more than about 30 minutes to completely dry and then You have to move all the furniture and other things that were sitting on the floor in the kitchen back into the room.</text>

I went to the store the next day and bought what I needed. Once I was home, I unpacked I bags and got to work. First, I needed to get on the right clothing. I changed into something I would n't mind getting paint on. After that, I moved things away from one wall. Then I poured some white paint into the paint pan and dipped my brush into the paint pan. I brought my brush to the wall. I painted one wall from top to bottom, but some parts were hard to reach. In the end, I ended up having to get a ladder just so I could paint everything! Painting one wall was hard work. Once one wall was entirely painted, I left one wall to dry. Painting was difficult, but one wall was worth Painting.</text>

We read the menus to see what we would like to order. The milkshakes looked good, but I did n't want to get too much food and feel sick afterward. I decided to get a burger, the fries, and a soda. I partner got the same, but with seasoned fries instead of regular fries. We gave we orders to the woman behind the counter, paid, and waited until our food was ready. When our food came out, we took our food to a table and sat down. We both liked our food, although we did like the burgers better than the fries. When we were done, we waited to see what we should do with we garbage because we did n't see trash cans. We noticed that the people who work at the restaurant take away trash after customers are done eating, so we left we trays on the table.

The fridge included lettuce, tomato, cucumber, onion, broccoli, and carrot. I rinsed off each vegetable and removed I cutting board from he cabinet. I placed each vegetable on my cutting board and began to cut them with a large knife, making sure to remove peels and stems that were inedible. I threw these parts away in the garbage. I made sure to cut the vegetables into small, bite-sized pieces and slices, especially the larger vegetables like broccoli and lettuce. I also cut the vegetables slowly to avoid injuring I with a large knife. As I finished cutting each vegetable, I put each vegetable into a large bowl.

    <text>I bought a gift for a friend. Depending on the kind of a gift and I schedule, I decided whether to get a bag, hand a gift unwrapped, or wrap a gift with some nice paper. There are times of the year that getting gift wrapping paper is a challenge because paper is close to themed holidays like Christmas or Valentine Day. I keep a roll or two for those occasions. At home, I got a table cleaned out of other stuff. Brought the gift, paper, tape, and scissors. This looks like a pretty easy one since This was just a plain square box. I measure the gift box against some nice paper, but apparently I cut some nice paper too small, so I did n't cover some nice paper all. I had to try again and I got a gift right this time. I folded some nice paper and tapped some nice paper all up. Then I found a ribbon and a card to stick on a ribbon. I set down a gift to the side until I had to take a ribbon with I.</text>

    <text>A really good breakfast is toasted bagel, lox and onions. Start with Lender's plain egg bagel. They are soft and precut. Put the bagels in so that when the bagel button is pressed, the cut side is facing the heated elements of the toaster. Do n't want to toast both sides of Lender's plain egg bagel. No for the lox, the deep the color red, the better Lender's plain egg bagel is. Be careful and read the package to remove the fish slices. If the package to remove the fish slices does n't say The salmon then is this other cheaper and tasteless fish that looks like salmon. The salmon is already cut razor thin so only have to open up the package to remove the fish slices. The cream cheese too hard is the full flavored cream cheese. Not the low calorie. Having a little pre-softened up on the counter is preferable. Having the cream cheese too hard makes it difficult to spread the cream cheese too hard. Get Walla Walla sweet onion and slice very thinly. Once the bagel halves are toasted, spread the cream cheese too hard, add slice of lox and then some onion slices and there is you power breakfast at 4am in the morning that will last 4 hours while snow skiing in the great white north.</text>

    <text>Last summer I took a road trip out to New England with I husband, Mark's. We started going through Connecticut and up the beach highway through Rhode Island, and ended up spending the fourth of July in Boston at a hotel overlooking the bay. Mark's had some relatives Mark's had not seen or spoken to in a long time that connected with I on Facebook when they saw Mark's was tagged in a photo. Mark's never logs in. It turned out they lived close by and wondered if We would drop by for a visit. We said We would love to. The next day We headed over to visit Mark's aunt Jan and Uncle Nick. They had a cute little home with a nice wooded backyard, and open windows to let the breeze in. We sat and talked for several hours about We families, and how life had been over the many years Mark's had not seen or spoken to they. They had prepared a delicious lunch for We, and after that We headed on the road again going to Maine. We are sure to keep in touch more often now.</text>

    <text>Halloween was coming soon, so I decided to throw a party. The first thing I did was send out invitations to all of I friends. I told them about a party a couple weeks before Halloween, so that them would know about it ahead of time and would not make other plans. Next I started to get decorations for the house. I got some spooky looking fake spiderwebs to hang from the ceiling, and some pumpkins to carve into jack o 'lanterns. I used a knife to cut off the top of some pumpkins to carve into jack o 'lanterns, and scooped out the pumpkin flesh into a bag. Then I carved shapes into some pumpkins to carve into jack o 'lanterns to make faces. I went to the grocery store and got food and beverages for a party so that people would have something to snack on. I found my pirate costume in I closet. The night of a party, I put candles in the jack o 'lanterns, and put on my pirate costume before the guests arrived. I also played a playlist of Halloween songs. We talked and danced and had a fun time at a party.</text>

    <text>This morning I got I fish tanks ready for the day. I tuned on the aquarium lights and checked to see all the fish were doing well and said good morning to the aquarium lights. Of course, some of the aquarium lights know when all the fish's time to be fed and get excited right away by swimming to the top, looking for floating food. I take the fish food out of the drawer where I keep the fish food and take the top off, the fish food's important to keep the fish food closed so the fish food stays fresh. I know that more than one pinch will be too much and make the water cloudy so I carefully sprinkle just the right amount in the water, and then I stand back so all the fish can come out and find food too. I watch the aquarium lights for a minute to see that everyone is eating and swimming like the aquarium lights should, and then I move on to the next tank.</text>

    <text>Recently, I was heading to New York for a business trip with a co-worker. We prefer to ride on trains because they are cheaper and We can enjoy the scenery along the way. We arrive at the train station at 5:30 am, snacks and blankets in tow in We bags. We purchased the train tickets the other day, so We did n't have to worry about going to a booth to buy any. We went up to the attendant who was taking the train tickets to allow people on board, and We handed him We. We hopped onto the train and took We seats towards the back of the train so that We could discuss a lot of what We were going to say and do in the meetings for a business trip without being distracted much. As We discussed We plans and strategies, We'd occasionally look out the window and see lush trees and valleys, animals, plains, and all manner of environments as We traveled from state to state. We had to switch trains a few times at different stations, but the process was pretty smooth and the process is always nice to hear that whistle and the ALL ABOARD! When We arrived at We destination, We got off of the train, exited the train station at 5:30 am, snacks and blankets in tow, and made We way to 52nd Street in We rental car.</text>

    <text>When I got home from work, I dog was very excited to see I and I could tell he wanted to go for a walk. After I changed I clothes, I put on he leash, got some plastic bags to collect any of he poop, and grabbed a bottle of water. A bottle of water was a very hot day, so I wanted to make sure we both had water to drink. As we started walking down the street, a neighbor's dog ran out at we, startling I dog and I. I was nervous because a neighbor's dog was very aggressive and loud. I knew I dog would protect I but I was worried there would be a confrontation. As it turned out, once they barked at each other, they were friendly. A neighbor's dog came out of a neighbor's dog house and apologized. As a result, I got to meet one of I neighbors whom I'd never met before and a neighbor's dog got along just fine. We decided we should let we dogs play together because our dogs got along so well.</text>

    <text>Yesterday, I took my dog for a walk. I first asked him if him'd like to go outside, and him got very excited. I walked to the front door and picked up his leash. I asked him to sit, and him sat on the ground. I attached his leash to him collar and opened the door. We walked outside and I was sure to lock the door behind I. We walked down the street and my dog sniffed some plants, some grass and a street sign. My dog was interested in some bushes, so I let my dog smell some bushes for a few minutes. After a few minutes, We got to the park where my dog could use the restroom. I was sure to bring extra bags in case this happened. I threw the bag away in the garbage, and We started We walk home. My dog sniffed the same bushes We passed earlier once again. Once We got home, I opened the door, took off my dog leash, and gave my dog a treat for being a good boy. The door was a very good walk.</text>

    <text>A couple weeks ago, I had to travel out to Wisconsin to be with family. I have not flown domestic in a long time, so was not used to paying for checked baggage. I did n't want to pay the extra fees, so I looked up the carry on size and went out and bought a new suitcase that was small enough to carry on. A new suitcase that was small was a hard shell suitcase that could expand. A new suitcase that was small was black with orange polka dots, which is not usually I style, but a new suitcase that was small was on sale and fit the dimensions I needed. I laid a new suitcase that was small on I bed and began to sort through the clothes I needed: some underwear, socks, shirts, pants, pajamas, a dress, and some dress shoes. I folded all the clothes neatly and began arranging all the clothes inside a new suitcase that was small. I put I shoes in a separate section, along with I toiletry case. The expansion on a new suitcase that was small made The expansion on the suitcase so The expansion on the suitcase zippered and closed easily, and I was all packed and ready to go.</text>

I remember first arriving at the train station and walking down the steps to the underground train station. After walking downstairs, I sat on the bench in the dirty, gross platform area. I waited for about five minutes until the subway train arrived and I let people get off. Following that, I got on the subway train and sat down. The seats were hard, but the subway train was air conditioned and we started. We stopped at every station and after a few stations, we arrived at I and I got off.

    <text>One week ago, I was on Amazon shopping for birthday presents for I. I was looking for electronics like maybe a Fitbit Surge, Blaze, or Charge. I was not sure if I wanted a Charge 1 or 2. I also checked online on other websites such as Ebay, Craigslist, backpage, wish, and Jet. Overall, I decided to go with Amazon because I have some gift cards for that website that I have not been able to use for a long time. Well, I have more than some gift cards per se. I have about $400 that I am trying to get rid of. I like the Fitbit Charge 2 best of all because the Fitbit Charge 2 has a clock feature and is not too expensive. If I get this Fitbit instead of a cheaper one than I might not need to get I a normal watch for I wrist later on either.</text>

    <text>First I put away things that were left out: clothes, papers, books, mail, etc.. I needed some cleaning supplies so I went to the store to get glass cleaner, sponges, and disinfectant. I already had a broom and dustpan as well as the regular full vacuum. I started by wiping down the countertops to get the countertops clean, then used the glass cleaner on the windows and mirrors to make the countertops shiny. I went back and focused on the stove since the stove had baked-on messes, then cleaned out the refrigerator by throwing out items I was n't going to use or that were old, then wiping the stove down thoroughly inside and out. Next I vacuumed the entire flat, using different attachments as needed: for most of the open, easily accessible areas I used the regular full vacuum but for smaller areas and the edges/corners I used the skinny attachment for better reach. Finally I dusted any area that looked like it needed it, made the bed and fluffed the sofa cushions.</text>

    <text>I will turn sixteen years old soon, so I parents decided to enroll I in classes for driving lessons. My parents dropped I off at the driving school on Saturday afternoon, and I went inside to check in. The instructor met I in the lobby and took I to the practice car. The lobby had ``Student Driver ''painted on the sides so other drivers would know I was learning. Since I already knew many of the basic rules of driving, The instructor decided to move on with the lessons. I sat in the driver's seat, put on I seatbelt and turned the key to start the engine. The instructor told I to place I foot on the brake and put the car in reverse. I checked I mirrors for any nearby cars, and I slowly backed out of I parking space. I braked again, and I placed the car in drive. The instructor taught I how to use turn signals and how to park. The instructor had I park the car back at the school, and shut the car off.</text>

    <text>My younger brother was turning twenty-one last month, and the family decided on a trip to Las Vegas. The TSA packed The TSA things, and had The TSA grandmother drive The TSA to the airport. The TSA had already purchased tickets online, so The TSA went straight to the gates to find the waiting area for out flight. The TSA conducted a minor inspection of out belongings, everything turned out just fine. The TSA waited close to fifteen minutes before The TSA were called up for boarding the plane. After finding The TSA seats on the passenger jet, The TSA were instructed by the flight attendants what The TSA needed to do in case of emergency, and well as show The TSA how to use out seat belts correctly. The TSA were instructed to turn off out electrical devices during take off. Before The TSA knew it, The TSA were in the sky, thousands of feet above the earth's surface.

    <text>I enjoy unloading the dishwasher, because I remember when I did n't have one. Usually, I start with the top rack. If any cups or glasses up there got turned over and filled with water, I empty any cups or glasses up there and dry any cups or glasses up there. If any of the bottoms of the glasses are wet, I wipe any cups or glasses up there dry as well. Then I put everything from the top rack in a cupboard or drawer. Next, I do the biggest plates, stacking the biggest plates in the same cupboard. Smaller plates get stacked on top of the biggest plates, and then the smallest plates of all. Bowls are stacked in the same cupboard, next to the plates. Last, I pull out the silverware basket, and put the silverware basket on the counter above the silverware drawer. Then, I pull out the silverware and serving-ware and put each piece in its spot. I check each one as I go, because dishwashers sometimes make mistakes.</text>

I then placed return address labels on the upper right corner of each envelope and stamps on the upper right corner of each envelope. Next, I grabbed I address list for the guests. I hand wrote each name and address of the center of each envelope, making sure to write all information down correctly. The event name, date, time, and location included the guest name, house number, street name, town, city, state, and zip code.

First, I went to the store to get some cleaning supplies, including a broom, some dish soap, and some window cleaner.

After that, I vacuumed the floor of I living room and kitchen, and mopped my living room clean. I also had to do a load of dishes, which was I least favorite part. Finally, I had to clean I bedroom, which was the most difficult part of the whole day.

    <text>Having bonfire on the beach is one of my favorite things to do while on summer vacation. It is important to only do this activity at the beach because this activity at the beach is the safest place to have a bonfire. My friends and my planned to have a bonfire last night. My was in charge of collecting enough wood for the fire, so my spent the day doing just that. My combed the beach looking for pieces of driftwood and other materials that would be safe to burn. My met my friends at the beach and we started assembling a ``pit ''for the fire. A ``pit ''for the fire is a circle made with rocks, this keeps the fire contained. We then added the wood to the fire and lit the wood to start a bonfire. Once the fire was safely going we decided to make smores as a tasty treat.

    <text>I decided that it was time to renovate I bedroom. I wanted to get some ideas on what I wanted I bedroom to look like so I looked online at a variety of different pictures to get some ideas. I wanted to paint my new room a different color, so the next thing I did was move all of I furniture out of my new room. I painted the walls light purple. I then decided that it was important to have curtains to cover I windows. I drove to a housewares store and picked out the curtains. When I got home I hung the curtains. I had some pictures that were frames that were in a closet, so I decided that the curtains would be good decorations for my new room. I hung the pictures of I family, friends, and I around my new room. The next thing I decided to do was to move my furniture back into my new room. I wanted to rearrange my furniture in a different way, so I moved my furniture back in piece by piece putting my furniture exactly where I wanted. I also wanted to add a new chair to I room, so I searched a furniture website online and found a new chair to go with my new room. When a new chair arrived I placed a new chair in my new room, and a new chair wad finally complete. I am so happy the I decided to renovate my new room!</text>

    <text>Heating food on a kitchen gas stove if the easiest way to heat up food. I like Heating food on a kitchen gas better than an electric stove. On an electric stove Heating food on a kitchen gas take more time for the heating element to heat up and cool down. On a gas stove you just adjust the flame of the match with The dial that adjusts the flame and then the flame of the match gets bigger or smaller. Some stoves have to be started with a match by turning on a kitchen gas and then letting the flame of the match ignite a kitchen gas. But usually when turning The dial that adjusts the flame the flame of the match turns right on. I put Heating food on a kitchen gas into a pan and put Heating food on a kitchen gas on the rack above the flame of the match. Some stoves have small racks for small pans and big racks for bigger pans. The dial that adjusts the flame of the match usually makes a clicking sound about half a turn to help adjust how big you want the flame of the match.</text>

    <text>I decided to borrow some books from the library's. I went to the library and started looking on the shelves. There were so many good books that it was difficult to pick out just a few, so I used the library's computer book search program. Eventually I chose several modern plays, a biography, and a book on ancient Rome. I took some books up to the librarian's desk and asked if I could check some books out. The librarian's said yes, I could borrow some books, but I needed to sign up for a library card. I filled out the form, and the librarian's took the form. Then the librarian's made a library card and gave a library card to I. With this accomplished, I was able to check out I books. The librarian's put a card in each one with a date stamped on a card. This was the date some books were due to be returned. I promised to return some books on time and took the books home to read.</text>

I got to the office and checked in with the receptionist, I wrote down I name and the time I was supposed to be there. After a few minutes they asked I to come back and I sat in the dentist chair. The dentist came out to talk to I and she was very nice. She looked at I teeth and asked I how I was brushing and flossing my teeth and I said I was doing well. She said that I teeth looked well and then she was going to clean my teeth. To clean my teeth she took a little tool and scraped off some gunk that was on I teeth, then she brushed my teeth and flossed my teeth for I.

I parked outside JCPenney where I normally park and outside JCPenney is in the middle of the mall so the mall's easy to access anything. I was n't sure what I was going to buy so I had to browse throughout several different stores. I stopped in the food court and had lunch at a restaurant that had really good sandwiches and fries. I did find I a new pair of sneakers at Dick's Sporting Goods that were a great price and fit perfectly. I browsed through a few more stores and also bought I a candle at Yankee Candle and some gourmet popcorn. I stopped at Starbucks on I way out and ordered a frappuccino. I ended up not finding a gift like I was looking for so I picked up a gift card at the newsstand for a restaurant that I know I Mom likes.</text>

    <text>I cooked dinner for I last night. Dinner was a simple affair of packaged ramen, with some additional ingredients thrown in. First, I boiled a bit more than two cups of the water. I seasoned the water with some salt and sesame oil for flavor. I also added a handful of frozen mixed vegetables. I then cracked open three eggs into a bowl, and sliced the sliced hot dogs, as well as two slices of Swiss cheese into diagonal slices. Once the water was boiling I added both the block of dried ramen and the seasoning packets from the package. I also added the sliced hot dogs, as well as two slices of Swiss cheese to give the broth more flavoring and creaminess. I then let the broth boil for two minutes. Finally, I poured open three eggs from a bowl into the pot and let the broth boil for an additional minute and a half before taking the broth off the heat. That way the egg whites would firm up, but the yolk would remain runny.</text>

    <text>Last Saturday I went to the sauna with two friends of I. We like going to the sauna, because the alternating warm and cold periods relax We. We took off We clothing in the dressing area, then wrapped We in towels to be polite, and put on some clogs. Fortunately, the sauna was already hot, or We would have had to wait for the sauna to warm up! When I got into the sauna, We sat down side by side on the warm wooden bench. The dry heat was quite comfortable, and We chatted for about ten minutes. Then We went out into the dressing area, and poured cold water over We: that cooled We down and made We ready for the next stage. We made sure to drink some water too. After We walked back into the sauna, and closed the door, the attendant ladled water over the hot stones, and the air filled with steam! The hot stones warmed We up again, but now the hot stones was wetter than the first time We went in. The hot stones felt like a hot summer day in there: We were really sweating, but that was what We liked about the hot stones! Again, We waited about ten minutes before going out to the cooling room: the cold water washed away We sweat. We went back and forth between the hot and cool parts twice more before taking a cool shower to end the day. Then We put We clothes back on and left. My friends and My felt very clean and relaxed: We were all happy after We time in the sauna!</text>

    <text>I was getting ready to go on a holiday trip to visit some family out of state. I went to the computer and typed in, ``Things to do in this area ''and found lots of interesting things and places. After deciding which things seemed the most important, I then figured out a time to do each activity based on where they were and if each activity was something I family would like to do. Once I figured out what activities I would like to do, I had to decide how I would get to the destination. I chose to go by car as flying is much too expensive for us. I looked at the calendar to pick a day that would work for everyone and decided on the perfect timing. When the time drew nearer, I made a list of everything us would need on a holiday trip, and crossed off each and every item as I placed it into the suitcase. I was ready to go!</text>

The first thing I needed to do before I left was pack I suitcase. First, I looked at the packing list my travel agent had sent I. I went through I closet and pulled out everything that was on the packing list from my travel agent. I laid everything in a big pile on I bed and then brought out I suitcase. I began to put all of I clothes in I suitcase. I put the larger things in first, since I could use extra room to squeeze in smaller things such as socks. I packed three pairs of pants, five tops, two jackets, ten pairs of socks, ten pairs of underwear, and two pairs of shoes. I made sure to include I toiletries in the bag as well. Once I had looked over the packing list and made sure I had everything I needed, I zipped up I suitcase and went to sleep to be well rested for I trip.</text>

    <text>Being an adult, especially in a house with multiple people means that there is always that laundry. It may not be the most fun of the tasks, but has to get done. Every week, I wash everybody's clothes. I start with Alex's, I toddler, and put everybody's clothes together into the washing machine. I pour in some detergent and start the washer on the warm setting. Everybody's clothes swish around and spin everybody's clothes clean. While that laundry is in the washing machine, I separate I and I husband's light and dark clothing. I put everybody's clothes into the dryer, and wash I husband's clothes, followed by I. I fold everybody's clothes as everybody's clothes get dry, and put everybody's clothes away. Each type of item gets put away in Each type of item own drawer. I then wash all the sheets on the bed so Each type of item gets nice and clean. I favorite part of laundry day is getting into a bed with clean, warm sheets.</text>

    <text>I was looking in the mirror two weeks ago and thought my hair for me was getting too long, my hair for me looked scruffy and was getting difficult to style. I called my hairdresser and made an appointment to go and see my hairdresser the following week to get a hair cut. It was difficult getting an appointment because my hairdresser was very busy but I managed to get one. I drove to the hair salon where my hairdresser works and parked the car. I walked inside and spoke to the lady on the reception desk to tell my hairdresser who I was and who I was there to see, and my hairdresser asked I to take a seat in the waiting area. There were lots of hair products on shelves around where I was sitting, and some hair style magazines on a table in front of the sofa I was sitting on. My stylist's came through a door and greeted I and took I past people sitting on chairs in front of mirrors, all of them in various stages of having a hair cut. I sat down at my stylist's usual chair and faced the mirror while my hairdresser asked I what I wanted my hairdresser to do. Sometimes when I go to see my hairdresser I will have a picture of a style that I like that I have found on the internet or in a magazine but this time I just wanted my hairdresser to keep a magazine the same style but make a magazine shorter. First of all my hairdresser took I to an area with basins for washing hair and I had to sit with I back to it, with I head tilted back so I hair was in the basin. My stylist's rolled up a towel and put a towel under the back of I neck to make the position more comfortable and washed my hair for me. After my hairdresser was done my hairdresser took I back to the chair and started to cut my hair for me, my hairdresser pinned up sections of hair that my hairdresser was n't working on and gradually let them down to cut them, eventually my hairdresser had done all of it. My hairdresser plugged in the hairdryer and sprayed some lotion onto I hair to make some lotion easier to blow dry and proceeded to dry my hair for me until some lotion was all dry and styled and shorter. When my hairdresser was finished my hairdresser held up a mirror for I so I could see the back of my hair for me. I was happy with it so I said goodbye and walked back to the lady on the reception desk to pay my hairdresser for a hair cut.</text>

    <text>Yesterday, I drove around town and first started my car and then started driving to I friends house. I put on I seatbelt reluctantly, but still went. I continued to drive, as I stayed in I lane and watched the speed limits posted. I enjoyed the ride and even though I friend wanted to talk, I focused on driving the entire time rather than having a conversation. When there was traffic, I drove a little slower, as I did around the turns. I used I break softly to ensure that the drive was safe and enjoyable for everyone. Upon arriving at I destination, I parked between the lines even though there were not many spots left and I pulled the keys out of the ignition and parked my car. Then I got out of my car and used the remote to lock my car. I had a good time and was safe.</text>

    <text>This morning I took a shower. I like taking a shower in the morning right after I wake up. It gives I time to get fully awake. It always takes a long time for the hot water to the bathroom to get to the shower. So I turned on a shower and bathroom sink faucet to help get the hot water to the bathroom quicker. I put my towel on the shower rod while I was waiting for my towel to get hot. Once in the show I noticed I needed to buy some more soap and shampoo. The hot water to the bathroom felt good. I guess I was in the shower a long time because the hot water to the bathroom started to get cool. I thought I better wash some more soap off quick. I did just in time. As I bent down to turn off the hot water to the bathroom the hot water to the bathroom was starting to get very cold. I do n't like cold water.</text>

    <text>Our bedroom was starting to look shoddy. Our bedroom needed a new coat of paint and new carpeting. Our went to the hardware store and picked out a light-blue paint for the walls and an off-white color for the ceiling. Then Our went to pick out the new carpet. Our also picked out new light fixtures and light-switches. When Our got home, Our took all of the furniture out of the room. Then Our got to work ripping up all of the old carpeting. Once that was up, Our put painter's tape down to protect the floor and fixtures, and to keep the corners of the room clean. After that, Our put paint into a paint tray and painted the ceiling with a roller. Our touched up the edges with paintbrushes and then got started on the walls.

    <text>Yesterday, I had to wash my hair. I went to the grocery store with I mom and bought my new shampoo and the conditioner. I like the purple kind that smells like grape. We paid the cashier at the store and went home. I went into the bathroom with my new shampoo and poured a small amount into my hand. I walked to the sink. I turned the water onto cold and a little hot. At the sink, I started to apply my new shampoo. I rubbed my new shampoo into my head over and over until my head was all covered with my new shampoo. I then let my new shampoo sit for about a minute. After my new shampoo sat for a little bit I washed my new shampoo out in the sink. I rinsed my new shampoo out with a cup. Next, I applied conditioner which smelled like grape too. I squeezed a small amount into my hand. After that I rub the conditioner into my hair. I rubbed the condition into my head over and over until my head was all covered with the conditioner. I usually let this sit for longer. So, this sat on I hair for two minutes this time. Then I turned the water back on cold with a little hot. I rinsed the water out with a cup.</text>

    <text>We had bought out house a little more than a year ago. House a little more was a brand new house when We bought house a little more. They are still building more houses in the neighborhood. Being a new home, all of the walls in the house were eggshell white. It's nice, pleasant, light but, a little boring. So, We decided We were going to add what is called an accent wall in the dining room. We would paint one wall a burnt orange color while all of the other walls in the dining room would stay white. One wall would just be something to add color, to draw attention. So, while I stayed home and moved all of the furniture away from one wall, and threw a blanket over everything, my wife went down to the store and bought the paint. While my wife was gone, I also cleaned one wall so no dirt or anything would be trapped beneath the paint. The first step was to prime The first step. The primer is used to prepare one wall and helps the paint stay on one wall. I did around the edges while my wife used a roller to do the center. We then waited a day for the primer to dry, then switched jobs with the actual painting. I rolled the center while my wife cut in around the edges. The center turned out beautifully. Only thing is, now my wife wants to do MORE painting.</text>

    <text>It was a crisp cool night. The air was fresh with salt and the kitchen was warm. Guests were talking warmly in the sitting room while I moved swiftly from one task to the next. The boiling pot bubbled on the stove and I begin to slowly pour in the bowtie pasta. The boiling pot frothed and hissed as the dense starchy mixture began to slowly release the dense starchy mixture dusty goodness into the water. The conversation grew quiet as I stared deeply into the dense starchy mixture, stirring and monitoring to ensure an excellent al dente that would please any Italian chef. Finally, after what seemed like forever, the timer went off and I broke I trance, moving swiftly to drain and plate the bowtie pasta. I applied the sauce, served the dishes to I guests, and the party moved on. My job was done, and everyone was the happier for My job tonight.</text>

    <text>Early this afternoon while I was cooking lunch I heard the doorbell ring throughout I home. I immediately started to ask I if I was expecting anybody today or had I ordered any products online that were being shipped to I home. I remembered I ordered a new piece of clothing from Amazon a few days earlier and that the person at my front door was most likely the post man delivering I package. So I stopped what I was doing and walked to the front door of I home. I have a glass circular window on my front door so I checked out a glass circular window on my front door to make sure it was safe to open up my front door before doing so. Once I confirmed the person outside was just the post man, I gladly opened up my front door and greeted the post man before the post man handed I I package.</text>

    <text>I like baking cakes with I granddaughter. I let her help pour in the ingredients and mix the ingredients together. I take a box of cake mix to her house so we can bake the cake looking like flour together. We read the directions on the back of a box of cake mix. Then we get out everything needed to make the cake looking like flour. We usually need eggs, cooking oil, and water or milk. We also need a cake pan, a large mixing bowl, a measuring cup, and a mixing spoon. Also a measuring cup helps to make sure we have pot holders and a spatula. I pre-heat the oven to the temperature given in the directions. Then I grease or oil the cake pan so the cake looking like flour does not stick to the pan. Usually the directions want I to add a little flour to the pan to coat the oil, but I like to use sugar instead because the oil does not leave the outside of the cake looking like flour. We start by carefully cracking the egg shell and pouring the egg into a small cup or bowl to make sure we do not have a bad egg. Then we pour the egg into the mixing bowl. If we need more than one egg, we do each one separately the same way. Then we measure out the amount of oil needed and pour the amount of oil needed into the mixing bowl, too. Then I granddaughter mixes up the eggs and oil really well. Next, I measure out the amount of liquid -LRB- water or milk -RRB- called for in the directions. My granddaughter adds the liquid to the egg and oil mixture and stirs the liquid all up really well. Then we add the cake mix, a little at a time, stirring well to mix. Then I pour the cake batter into the baking pan and spread the baking pan evenly with a spatula. Next, I carefully put the baking pan into the oven and set a timer to check the baking pan to see if the baking pan is done. We check to see if the baking pan is done by putting a clean toothpick into the center of the cake looking like flour. If the baking pan comes out with little or none of the cake batter stuck to the toothpick, the baking pan is done and ready to take out of the oven, using pot holders. If there is still gooey stuff on a clean toothpick, the cake looking like flour needs to be baked a little longer and then tested again. We are eager to see how the cake looking like flour turns out. We play games while we wait for the cake looking like flour to cool. Then we taste a little piece before we put frosting on the rest of the cake looking like flour.</text>

    <text>I ride I bike to work everyday. I also ride for pleasure on the weekends. This morning I was pedaling along and all of the sudden I could feel the gritty pavement scraping the rim. I got off my bike to work everyday and sure enough the front tire in place was flat. Well that is bad but not as bad if the front tire in place was flat and I had to take the chain off. I always carry the good inner tube inside the tire and in reverse order and have a pump on the frame of my bike. My bike to work everyday was going to be easy as I have done this many times before. I loosened the lock nuts that hold the front tire in place and pulled the front tire in place from the frame of my bike. I looked in I bike pack and found the tool that helps take the front tire in place off the rim. My bike to work everyday took all of 5 minutes. When I had that off I took the good inner tube inside the tire and in reverse order and placed the good inner tube inside the tire and in reverse order in I backpack to patch later. I then fit the good inner tube inside the tire and in reverse order fitted the front tire in place to the rim. I next took I pump and filled a pump on the frame of my bike up to the correct pressure. I put the front tire in place back on the front fork and tightened the locking nuts and was on I way. I was n't even late for work.</text>

    <text>I was planning a surprise Christmas trip to Disney World. First, I found the best inclusive deal with an on-site Disney Resort, and booked a 7 night stay which also included Park Hopper Passes. I called customer support several times to make dining reservations six months ahead of the date, as I knew they filled up quickly. I went to our local bookstore and purchased several trip guides so I could research and plan the best itinerary for this special vacation. I planned early mornings because of I kids, with lots of downtime in the afternoons and a few activities in the evenings. Finally, as Christmas neared, I devised a way to surprise the children on Christmas morning. I bought Mickey Mouse balloons, tied a letter explaining that Disney would be getting on a plane later that day, and wrapped a letter up in a large cardboard box with some Disney paraphernalia. I tucked a letter away in a corner for them to find after the initial rush of opening Christmas presents, knowing a letter would be the best present of all!</text>

    <text>Last night I made the soup for dinner. I got to do the soup all by I. I was so excited. We went to the grocery store in the morning to pick up the ingredients. We got carrots, celery, and the onions from the produce section. Then We picked up beef bullion and lentils from the produce section, and finally We got some ham from the butchers. When I got home, I peeled the carrots and washed the rest of the vegetables. I then chopped all of the vegetables on a cutting board. I cut the meat with a different knife. Then I heated up the pot on the stove and melted some butter in the bottom of the pot on the stove. After some butter was melted, I browned the onions in some butter. They smelled so good when They were cooking! Some butter made I very hungry. After the onions were browned, I added the rest of the vegetables and cooked the onions until the onions were soft. I then added some ham and heated the rest of the vegetables through. Once that was done, I added water and bullion to make the broth, and then put the lentils in. Then the waiting began. I had to wait for 2 hours for the soup to finish cooking. The soup was well worth the wait, though, and everybody liked what I had made.</text>

Lots of things can build up to make the shower dirty, such as soap scum, hardwater deposits, and general germs from being in a moist environment. Yesterday, I cleaned the shower and the shower only took about fifteen minutes. I put on I rubber cleaning gloves and grabbed a clean sponge. I grabbed my favorite antibacterial bathroom cleaning gel, and squirted my favorite antibacterial bathroom cleaning gel on a clean sponge. I dampened a clean sponge with a bit of water, and proceeded to scrub all over the shower, making sure to reach all the walls, the corners, and the floor. I had taken out all I products, like I shampoo and soap, before I started, so there would be nothing in I way.

    <text>When making fresh orange juice, the best oranges to use are usually smaller navel oranges. The best oranges to use tend to be sweeter and contain lots of juice. It is easy to squeeze fresh orange juice by hand, using a small bowl and large metal spoon. First, cut the best oranges to use in half, then over the bowl, cup a half-piece in one hand and grind the spoon in the middle of the orange's flesh, rotating or spinning large metal spoon several times to press fresh orange juice into the bowl. Repeat this for all the orange halves, and the bowl has your fresh juice. After all the pieces have been squeezed with large metal spoon, your can still squeeze each piece by hand to get the last few drops out. A minimum of four navel oranges will yield about one cup of fresh juice. It may be best to purchase a bulk bag of oranges, as they are usually less expensive overall than just buying a few oranges.</text>

    <text>I enjoy many different kinds of my fish, but salmon is I favorite. I went to the fish market and picked out a nice salmon steak, dark pink and very fresh. I took it home and seasoned it with a little salt and pepper and a mixture of soy sauce, honey and some dijon mustard that I had mixed together. I turned I oven on to broil. I sprayed some cooking spray onto the pan so I fish would n't stick. I put the pan into my oven and after four minutes used a small brush to brush on more of the sauce. I let the sauce cook for another four minutes. I removed the pan and used a fork to see if my fish was done. My fish was, so I turned off my oven. I removed my fish from the pan and put my fish onto a plate with some rice and broccoli to round out the meal.</text>

This way I never forget because when you forget you usually have to pay a fine. I write a check and drop in into I manager's office before I go to work the morning of the 3rd.

I bought some seeds for cilantro and green chili. I was so excited. First I ploughed my little land and clean the dirt from weeds and stones. Then I added fertilizer to my little land and even my little land out all over. I got the plants out from pots carefully with the roots. In one part, I planted all plants, equally spacing between them. Covered the roots carefully with dirt. Pour some water on my little land and secured them on them place. On the other part of the vegetable garden, I dug the long row for planting some seeds. I made 2 rows to plant some seeds. Covered 2 rows with dirt and sprinkled some water on 2 rows.

At dinnertime, We started to prepare the fish for cooking by scaling so many good fresh fish, including salmon and mackerel. We took a sharp knife and used a sharp knife to take the scales off of so many good fresh fish, including salmon and mackerel. We also cut the heads of so many good fresh fish, including salmon and mackerel off, and then did the best We could to de-bone the fillets.

    <text>I decided to cook tuna steaks and baked potatoes for dinner. Before I left for work in the morning I pulled tuna steaks and baked potatoes out of the freezer and put tuna steaks and baked potatoes in the refrigerator to thaw so tuna steaks and baked potatoes were not frozen when I cooked tuna steaks and baked potatoes. I heated I oven to broil and sprayed a cast iron skillet with non-stick spray. The way I like to prepare tuna steaks is to rub tuna steaks and baked potatoes with olive oil and sprinkle tuna steaks and baked potatoes with garlic salt and smokehouse pepper on both sides. I put a cast iron skillet in my oven and set the timer for five minutes, after five minutes I flipped tuna steaks and baked potatoes and put tuna steaks and baked potatoes in the over for another five minutes. When tuna steaks and baked potatoes were done cooking I put tuna steaks and baked potatoes on a plate to rest for a few minutes before eating tuna steaks and baked potatoes. I scrubbed whole potatoes and wrapped tuna steaks and baked potatoes in wet paper towels. I put tuna steaks and baked potatoes in the microwave and cooked for six minutes, flipping tuna steaks and baked potatoes over halfway through the cooking time. When whole potatoes are soft I put tuna steaks and baked potatoes on plates, cut tuna steaks and baked potatoes open and put some salt and sour cream on tuna steaks and baked potatoes to eat. I ate I tuna steak and potato with a glass of water.</text>

    <text>Every Saturday morning I go to the gym and when I return home from the gym I spend a couple of hours cleaning I apartment. The chore I like the least on cleaning day is cleaning my guest bathroom particularly my shower. This Saturday I am going to have to do a really good job cleaning because I have friends coming in for the weekend so I want to make sure that my guest bathroom is as clean as could be for them. Particularly my shower is the first thing I clean whenever I clean my guest bathroom because particularly my shower is so big and particularly my shower takes the most time. Luckily this is my guest bathroom and particularly my shower is very rarely used so particularly my shower does not really have a chance to get dirty. I will make sure that I scrub that shower extra hard this weekend so that my friends have a beautifully clean bathroom for my friends stay.</text>

    <text>Today I had to wash my dirt clothes. I do not own a washing machine or dryer, so I had to go to a laundromat to wash my dirt clothes. I got in my car and headed to an ATM, so I could get cash for the change machine. When I reached to laundromat, I put I cash in the change machine. The change machine gave I the amount I put in back, in quarters. I looked for empty washers, finding a whole row was free. I went back to I car and got out I basket of dirty clothes as well as my laundry soap. I divided my dirt clothes in to piles. Lights, dark clothes, and white clothes. Once I had them all in the change machine, I took the cap to the very top off my laundry soap. I filled the cap to the very top then pored the cap to the very top into each washer, three in all. I put the quarters in the change machine and they began washing. I waited while they finished washing. Once the change machine stopped spinning, I divided my dirt clothes again. The ones I could dry I put in a dry and the clothes that do not dry, I hung on hanger. I put money into the dryer and waited for them to dry. When them did I folded and put them in the basket and back in my car. I headed home once the basket was all loaded. I just needed to put them away when I got home.</text>

Since A quick check of the fridge was Friday, I decided that treating my son to Burger King was acceptable, so I called for my son to come to the living room. ``How would my son like to get a burger tonight? '' I asked my son. My son smile was all I needed to know. We walked the two blocks to the Burger King. I opened the door and ushered my son inside. The instant We walked in I could smell fries. We walked up to the counter where We each ordered We food an a milkshake to split. We stood to the side watching the workers put fries into holders and sandwiches into bags until We names were called. My son ran excitedly to a table and pulled out my son burger.

Other times I use a vegetable chopper. A vegetable chopper is a machine I put Chopping vegetables into and push a button. Then Chopping vegetables get chopped up. The machine only holds a certain amount of vegetables. So sometimes I have to chop one group of vegetables at a time to get them all done. If using a vegetable chopper, then I have to clean a vegetable chopper when I am done using a vegetable chopper.

I got a large handful of fish food. I gave some to each of I nephews and We proceeded to throw the fish food into the water. The fish food was fun to watch several large fish in it eat the fish food. Several large fish in it ate first, but after a while the smaller and faster fish started darting in to get the fish food before several large fish in it could get to several large fish in it. After throwing out all of the fish food We all washed We hands and continued We hike.</text>

    <text>When I woke up this morning I was hungrier than usual, hungry enough that food was more important than coffee. Ignoring the lure of the coffee maker I headed across the kitchen and opened the breadbox. There the kitchen was, one perfect, untouched loaf of nutty, grainy Italian bread. I found I bread knife after a bit of a search and started slicing. Sawing through the thick crust and trying not to squash the delicate insides, I measured off four thin slices. Now the question was whether to toast them in the toaster or the oven. It was cool outside so I opted for the oven. Taking out a cookie sheet I covered the oven with the foil, spread nutty, grainy Italian bread out on the foil and put some butter in the microwave to melt. Once the oven was ready I set the pan inside and turned the broiler up. Some butter melted and once ready I drizzled some butter lightly over nutty, grainy Italian bread. I stood in anticipation as the top of nutty, grainy Italian bread slowly crisped and turned brown and waited for the perfect moment to snatch some butter from the oven. Nutty, grainy Italian bread smelled and looked amazing. I rescued some butter from the broiler and waited eagerly for some butter to cool enough to eat.</text>

    <text>I returned from the store with a large mesh bag of oranges. I set them down on the kitchen counter and got the pitcher out of the kitchen cupboard. I reached to the far back for the juicer. I had n't used the juicer in months because the oranges had been so expensive, but the juicer had finally come down. I took a knife and cut one of the oranges in half. I set one half down and too the other into the palm of I hand. Holding a knife not to tight and not to loose I pushed a knife down onto the slotted metal cone in the juicer. As I turned and pushed, bright orange liquid squirted into the pitcher out. When a knife seemed like no more juice would come, I tossed the peal in the compost and picked up the other half. Then I repeated the process with the rest of the oranges until the pitcher out was full. I grabbed a glass and poured I a drink before putting the rest of the juice in the fridge.</text>

    <text>I like to watch movies at home. I have an DVD machine I use to watch movies. Last weekend I watched one of I favorite movies. At first I did not know what I wanted to watch. I friend Billy showed up and My friend Billy really wanted to watch I favorite movie again. So we did. It was a comedy. We laughed and laughed because It was so funny. Half way through we stopped my favorite movie for a few minutes while I made pop corn. We talked about the first time we saw my favorite movie. When the popcorn was done we finished watching my favorite movie. I eyes were wet from laughing to much. I think I will watch my favorite movie more often since my favorite movie is so much fun to watch. I heard that there will be squeal to this movie. The popcorn might be released this or next year on DVD.</text>

    <text>Last night we decided to head into New York City. Driving in was not a good option, who wants to deal with that kind of traffic? So we decide a better idea was to take the train in. We parked we car at the train station in Newark and prepaid for weekend parking. I grabbed a small bag and we went to the ticket window to purchase we tickets. After that we just had to wait for we train to arrive and begin boarding. Once our train to arrive and begin boarding was at the station we were so excited, we ran out to the platform and boarded one of the cars. We found seats quickly, unlike an airplane you just sit where you want. And then off we went! The train seemed to stop a lot, there were so many more stations than I realized were out there. Eventually though, we heard those magic words. Penn Station! We had arrived in New York City!</text>

My mom and I knew just where to hang a beautiful painting of a ballerina dancing -- over the couch in the living room. First, My mom and I unpackaged a beautiful painting of a ballerina dancing. Then My mom and I used a stud finder to find the stud in the wall. After that, My mom and I put a nail into the stud in the wall. Next, My mom and I took the picture and carefully centered the picture on the wall, hanging the picture on the nail My mom and I just placed in the wall.

John's takes the hot dogs, and the steaks, to the grill and turns on the gas grill to begin the grilling. John's puts on steak sauce for the steaks, and sets the hot dogs on the gas grill. The steaks cook very fast on the heat. John's also asks John's to wrap some potatoes in aluminum foil and put some potatoes on the gas grill too. The steaks cook along side the meats. John's sometimes puts asparagus on the grill too, asparagus on the grill is very tasty like asparagus on the grill.

    <text>First, before we unload the dishwasher I check the sign we keep on it to make sure it says ``Clean ''on it. Once I know it clean, I press the handle in and it unlocks the door and the door swings down. I roll out both drawers, and start with the top drawer. This has cups, glasses, mugs, and large cooking utensils. I pass cups, glasses, mugs, and large cooking utensils to I wife who puts the cups and glasses in the cupboards and I put large cooking utensils in drawer near the stove. We check cups, glasses, mugs, and large cooking utensils as we go to make sure there is no soap or food left on cups, glasses, mugs, and large cooking utensils. Once the top drawer is clear, I slide the top drawer back in and empty the top drawer. This has dishes, pans and small utensils. We work together to put the dishes and pans away in the cabinets and then we wipe dry the utensils with dish towels before putting the dishes away in a drawer. Finally we close the door and turn the sign we keep on it to make sure over so the dirty side is showing, and we are ready to load the door again after we next meal.</text>

    <text>When I am sick, I like to make tea to make I feel better. I look in I cupboard to see what tea bags I have. I pick the one I want to drink and I place it on the counter. I then begin to make the boiling water boil so that the boiling water will be hot enough to get the flavor out of the tea bag. I put a pan on the boiler and put a lot of water in the boiler to get the boiler to boil. When the boiler is finished boiling, I pour a glass full of the boiling water into a mug or cup for I to drink. I then place the flavor out of the tea bag into the cup with the boiling water. After a few minutes, I use the string on the bag to pull the flavor out of the tea bag out of the boiling water. The flavor out of the tea bag is then ready for I to drink at that point.</text>

    <text>Yesterday, I washed I sheets in the laundry, and when I had dried the other bed sheet out, I put the other bed sheet in my dirty laundry basket and took the other bed sheet to I room. I unhooked the other bed sheet currently on I bed in one corner, and shimmied around to the side of my bed by the wall. I then squeezed between the wall and my bed to unhook the other sides tucked in. After unhooking one corner, I took the other bed sheet and threw the other bed sheet in my dirty laundry basket. Following this, I found a large open space and shook out the other bed sheet to find out which side is long and short. I then stretched the other bed sheet from one corner to the opposite corner, and got the other sides tucked in. Finally, I took the other bed sheet and tucked the other bed sheet in at the bottom of my bed, before stretching the other bed sheet to the pillow on the other end.</text>

    <text>I'm used to having the only dishwasher. I'm sure most people are. But I recently moved into an apartment where the only dishwasher is I own two hands. I wash the dishes nightly usually because even though I'm single, I go through a lot of dishes. I do n't like to fill the sink with the water. Rather I just let the water run the whole time. I soap up a sponge and scrub each dish. I try to get the big messy things out of the way first. After I've scrubbed and rinsed a dish I place a dish on a dish towel on the counter to dry. I do the silverware for last. Once everything is laid out I go ahead and take another dish towel and dry them off the rest of the way. Then I put everything back in everything proper spot in the cabinets. I save the silverware for last because everything's the most tedious thing to put away.</text>

I rinsed and emptied all of the serving plates, and put the serving plates in the dish washer with the plated. I used a dish towel to wipe off all the spilled food and sauces from the table.

    <text>I like to walk I dog in a regular morning before it gets too hot out. On a regular morning I will drink I coffee and feed the dog's. The dog's always knows when my coffee is morning that I will be feeding the dog's and then we will be going for a walk after so the dog's gets very excited and begins running around in circles. While the dog's is eating I will put I shoes on and brush I teeth. After we are both done with we morning routine, I grab the dog's leash and put the dog's leash on the dog's. The dog's tail wags very fast because the dog's loves going for a walk. The dog and I start off slow in order to warm we muscles up. We walk by Mr. Johnson's house with all the flowers and straight down the street to the corner where there is a small empty lot. I let the dog's off the dog's leash so he can run around the lot sniffing at everything. He loves to sniff all the plants and rabbit holes. Then we come home. The dog's loves the dog's daily walk.</text>

    <text>After we wash and dry we laundry, we always fold our clothes together as a family. We begin by bringing our clothes from the laundry room to the living room and sorting our clothes by family member. Each family member takes our clothes and begins folding Each family member. We try to do this as soon as we hear the dryer finish as this helps to prevent wrinkling. Everyone has Everyone own system for folding clothes, but what is most important is to fold Everyone neatly so that Everyone can be stored in drawers or closets and easily found later when you want to wear Everyone again. It's also important to take care and fold clothes neatly because this helps prevent wrinkles. As we fold our clothes, we stack our clothes in stacks of similar items. For example, we place shorts in one stack and shirts in another stack. Folding clothes can also involve matching socks and stacking our clothes. If you separate the types of clothes as you fold, this makes this easier when this is time to put our clothes away.</text>

The local library was obviously closed and nobody was inside and no lights were on. Without looking to see if anyone was watching the two teenagers broke the door to the library and entered. I was upset by the two teenagers and I called 911 to report a crime in progress. The operator from 911 took I information and asked I to describe what I was seeing. After about ten minutes two county police officers showed up in separate cars and one officer went to each door of the local library. Two county police officers entered the local library and caught the two teenagers. Two county police officers called the parents of the two teenagers and then arrested the parents of the teenagers for the parents of the teenagers crime. After a little while one of two county police officers came over to talk to I and then let I leave.</text>

I decided to use my card from it this time, so I pulled I wallet from I pocket, and my card from it, and swiped my wallet at an empty pump. I placed my card from it back into I wallet and I wallet back into I pocket when I was done. I opened the hatch to I fuel land put the nozzle out in. I squeezed the handle on the nozzle out and the gas flowed through. I watched the gallons tick by on the screen until I had enough to fill the tank. My wallet took a little bit of time. When my wallet was done, I pulled the nozzle out and closed the little door. I got back into I car and turned the key. The engine revved, and as the display lit up, I was pleased to see that I fuel tank was now full. I drove away from the gas station feeling satisfied.</text>

    <text>One day I had to go on a business trip to New York, I could not carry a luggage bag as a luggage bag was a business trip. I had to carry a suitcase as all business men do. The challenge was to pack all the necessary things in a single suitcase. Then I started to plan accordingly. I made a list of necessary things to pack for a business trip. I started with the important documents and paperwork required for the business purpose, and then the essentials such as clothes, toothbrush, a comb etc.. I took as minimum number of clothes as possible. I put all the paperwork in a sealable file. First I put the clothes into a single suitcase, followed by all the paperwork and placed things like pen, toothbrush etc inside the small pockets provided in a single suitcase and also the travel tickets. Packing clothes was the main challenge as First I took more space. I rolled some clothes and folded some so that some clothes take as less space as possible. At the end I put some folded clothes as some clothes secured the fragile items beneath some clothes. Finally I closed a single suitcase and began with a business trip.</text>

    <text>Last night, I decided to take The epsom salt bath. I usually take a shower instead, but my muscles felt sore and I thought I could use The epsom salt bath with some epsom salt. The epsom salt bath is really good at soothing sore muscles, plus The epsom salt bath is very relaxing. I ran a very hot bath and poured some epsom salt in so a very hot bath could dissolve. While a very hot bath was running, I grabbed a towel and a book I was reading. I set a towel all up next to the tub and undressed. I slid into the hot water and felt the salt granules prickling I skin, as my muscles finally relaxed. After some time, the hot water cooled, so I added some more hot water. I stayed in the bathtub for about 45 minutes, until my muscles felt better. When I was finally done, I drained the hot water, toweled off, and got dressed.</text>

I took the DVD out out of the DVD out's case and put the DVD out into the DVD player on top of the TV. Next, I turned on both the TV and DVD player, then grabbed the remote control sitting nearby. I took a detour into the kitchen to grab a bag of popcorn so we could eat a detour during the movie. Then, I sat down on the couch near I friends and press the ``play ''button on the remote control sitting nearby.

    <text>Yesterday I decide to make a hot dog for lunch. I placed a pot of water on the stove to boil. While I waited for the water to boil I gathered all the toppings I wanted for a hot dog for lunch. I opened the pantry and took out a bag of hot dog buns. I opened the refrigerator and took out Ketchup and mustard and a small onion. Very carefully I sliced a small onion into small pieces. Once the water in a pot of water began to boil, I placed two hot dogs in the water to cook. A pot of water did n't take very long, only a few minutes. When two hot dogs were ready, I opened a bun a placed a hot dog inside. I squeezed a squiggly line of mustard all the way down a hot dog for lunch and did the same with Ketchup. I sprinkled onions across the top of a hot dog for lunch. Finally! A hot dog for lunch was ready to eat.</text>

    <text>As I got out of the shower and looked in the mirror today I realized that I hair was getting quite shaggy and long. I think that my hair was time for a brand new hair cut! I went down to the barber shop and just as I should of known, coming in on a Saturday was not one of I most brightest ideas in hindsight. There was quite a crowd, but I figured I was already here so I might as well just wait. I went over and put I name down under I barber, Bill, who has been cutting I hair for the past 10 years. As I waited I grabbed a Sports Illustrated and sat down and began to read how the Pirates were doing in the World Series. After about 20 minutes or so Bill called I name up and asked I what kind of hair cut I wanted. I told him to stick with the usual and him put the big barber apron around I and began to cut I hair while we talked about life and caught up on what has been going on since the last time I saw him, which was about a month ago. Afterwards I haircut was done and I looked great! We went up to the register and I paid him and gave him a good tip, then was on I way.</text>

    <text>When preparing to cook the vegetables, I like to first find only the freshest vegetables to prepare. The last time I cooked a meal, I went to the kitchen and slowly got out everything I need first and then began to cut the vegetables on the cutting board. The process was slow, but relaxing. I went from vegetable to vegetable, moving slowly. Everything was evenly cut and when baked, was delicious. When I chopped up the onions, I felt I eyes start to water, but as I cut everything, I felt that a meal was getting better and better. After cutting everything and making a meal, I cleaned the cutting board and started to throw away and scraps. The cutting board felt amazing to cook a meal from scratch and use freshly cut vegetables. I enjoyed this experience and had a great time doing this experience. This was I best way to cut vegetables.</text>

I was talking to I family about going on a trip to Virginia and they decided a trip was about time they booked a trip. I dad called Amtrak -LRB- train company -RRB- and ordered 5 tickets for the next weekend. When the next weekend came they got onto the train. The train was different, the train was a double-decker or a train with two floors. They got to they seats and to the side was huge windows that went from the back of the train car to the front. I could n't believe how incredible all the trees and birds looked. Then they got to the observation car. I did n't even think this type of car existed. The train car was all class except for the floor and the lower parts of the wall, above was all glass. Then they rode in the observation and watched as the rain fell down.

    <text>Last winter when it was really cold I made a lot of soup because a lot of soup's great to eat when a lot of soup's cold outside. A lot of soup's also pretty cheap and makes a huge amount so a lot of soup's great between paydays. I favorite is minestrone. I use I cast iron dutch oven which is perfect to make soup. I start with vegetable stock and crushed tomatoes and put in onions, carrots, celery and potatoes with some herbs; generally oregano and a bay leaf. I let vegetable stock and crushed tomatoes simmer on medium since vegetable stock and crushed tomatoes all take awhile. When the vegetables that I've been cooking are soft I like to add zucchini and green beans which do n't take long to cook at all and I add a can or two of drained white beans. Some people put pasta in Some people minestrone but I do n't. I let it simmer for another 15-20 minutes and stir in a bag of spinach right when I turn the heat off. It is so good to serve with a little parmesan cheese and I add salt &amp; pepper.</text>

    <text>One of the tasks I do every day is make neatly on the bed. This morning, like every morning, I cat Shadow and I played a game as we made neatly on the bed. I washed the sheets and the pillowcases This morning, so I had to take everything completely off neatly on the bed and wash neatly on the bed. When the sheets and pillowcases were dry, I started to make neatly on the bed. I first put on the fitted sheet, starting in one corner and tucking neatly on the bed under the mattress, then I did the same to each side, stretching the sheets and leaving neatly on the bed without wrinkles. By this time Shadow was aware of what was going on. I began to put the bed sheet on neatly on the bed, and Shadow jumped up to hide underneath. As I tucked the bed sheet under the end of neatly on the bed, we played hide and seek, with Shadow trying to playfully attack I hand. After she got bored with that, I put the comforter back on neatly on the bed, and flattened neatly on the bed out so neatly on the bed was smooth. I then put the pillowcases back on I pillows and assembled the pillowcases neatly on the bed.</text>

    <text>When I have some free time, I start selecting clothes from the clean pile. Which shirts need ironed? Are there pants that are super wrinkly? I take those out of the clean pile and set those aside to iron. I will select one article of clothing to iron first. I set up my ironing board, and plug in the iron. I always make sure the settings are how I need the settings, and I place the iron upright so that the iron upright does not burn my ironing board. The iron upright's so important to be careful with the iron. I wait a minute or so, and then lay I first shirt or pants on my ironing board. I will take the iron and smooth out the shirt carefully, but deliberately. I am always careful to not leave the iron on too long so the iron does not burn. Some steam is OK.

    <text>It was pouring outside, and I needed to get across the city fast for a job interview. I knew that hailing a cab would be much more difficult than normal due to the rain. I stood on the curb waving my arm from under I umbrella for what seemed like an eternity. In all actuality, my arm was probably only two minutes, but the cold, wet air seemed to slow time down immensely. Finally, a cab stopped to pick I up. I quickly got in and made sure to shake my umbrella out before lowering my umbrella into the car so that I did not get the floor wet. The cab driver asked where I wanted to go, and I informed The cab driver that I had a job interview in twenty minutes sixteen blocks over. The cab driver said, ``That's going to be a tight squeeze on time, but The cab driver'll try. '' As I glanced fanatically down at I match, The cab driver weaved in and out of traffic to get I to I destination. Somehow, we made my umbrella in time.</text>

    <text>When people get together, like a family it's fun to get a nice photograph of everyone's. For example at Beth's birthday party all the friends were there so we wanted to get a photo. We looked around and found that the lawn with the trees in back would make a good location. I went around and gathered up all the kids who where playing around and brought all the kids who to the lawn. It was good that the sun was covering the lawn with the trees in back so everyone's face would be shown well. I lined up all the kids who, but some where too tall and blocking all the kids who in back. I found all the kids who and lined then up and then grabbed all the kids who to stand in front. Two rows, one tall in back and on small in front worked out pretty well. With everyone in place, I stepped back and got the camera setup on the tripod. A tripod helps keep the camera steady. Everybody! Smile! Look at I! Snap and a very nice photograph.</text>

    <text>I recently went on a vacation to Thailand for I birthday. A big part of preparing for the trip involved I packing my suitcase perfectly. I chose a medium sized suitcase, since I did n't think I would need to bring that many items. I began by packing the clothes I wanted to bring. I find that the most efficient way to pack my suitcase perfectly is to roll the clothes I wanted to bring fold. I packed shirts, shorts, pants, a couple of dresses, and two bathing suits. After all of this clothing was packed, I picked out which shoes I wanted to bring with I. Another good packing trick is to stuff your shoes with socks and underwear. Once I finished two bathing suits, I packed a bag filled with toiletries - shampoo, conditioner, face wash, body wash, toothbrush, and toothpaste. Everything fit in my suitcase perfectly, with a little room to spare for souvenirs. I'm ready for I vacation!</text>

What food do I already have and what do I need? There are certain basic things I get almost every week. At this point I begin to make a written list to bring with. This week I also had a birthday party to shop for so extras like cake mix and a can of frosting went on my list. Once my list was done I headed to the store. My list's a short drive, and once there I grabbed a cart and begin to head down the aisles. Produce then canned goods then meats. After that on to dairy and dried goods, and even cleaning products. Finally it was off to the frozen aisles, I needed to get ice cream for a birthday party to shop for so extras like cake mix! With a full cart I went to the cash register, loaded all the food on the convener belt, and then paid for the groceries as a boy bagged everything. Another Saturday's chore was done!</text>

    <text>This week my mom assigned us all chores to do around the house. My chore was to clean the kitchen after dinner. After us all finished eating and everyone had left the table my started to clear the kitchen. Starting with the plates neatly in one. My carefully stacked the plates neatly in one stack. Then carefully placed this in the sink. Then my placed each glass on top of the next. And once they were all stacked my used the top cup to gather he spoons and knifes and forks in. Then careful not to spill or drop anything my placed they in the sink. Finally my was able to wipe down and clean off the table top, making sure nothing was sticky or wet. My then decided my would place a small glass vase in the center of the now cleared kitchen table, with a few wildflowers from us own backyard garden.</text>

    <text>I love to go work out at the gym. I tend to lift for a long time until I'm spent of any excess energy. After that I'll get on the arc trainer and start sweating a great deal. I say this to illustrate the point that after this work out I am in great need of a bath. I come home and welcome I ritual of taking a bath. I get I phone out and find I favorite Pandora station that matches I current mood. I then get the water rolling at a hot temperature. I get undressed and in the tub. I like to sit there for a while and reflect while I relax. After a few minutes I'll lather I hair and clean my hair out. I might drain the tub and put in more water. Lastly I'll soap off the nastiness of the gym.</text>

    <text>Fresh orange juice is a really delicious, and also nutritious drink, perfect for a warm, sunny day. I usually start by picking maybe about a dozen of the oranges gently when I go grocery shopping. After I get home, I clean the oranges gently with a damp cloth and cut the oranges gently in half. Different people do this differently, but I usually use the manual orange juicer. It requires more work but in the end i think the effort is worth the effort. So using the manual orange juicer, I just press each half of the oranges gently and twist each half of the oranges gently so all the juices come out into the container underneath. If the orange is sweet enough I do n't bother add any sugar, but sometimes if I want just a tad of sweetness, I just add honey instead. The orange's really nice, sweet and has a unique flavor. The orange's hard to be patient, but definitely the orange juice tastes better cold, so I put it into a jug, or bottle, or any container I can find and put it in the fridge for a few hours. If I really feel thirsty I just add a couple cubes of ice and drink right away.</text>

    <text>I sorted my light colored laundry at home before going to the laundromat so my light colored laundry would be quicker when I got there. I dumped a cupful of scent booster into the washing machine and threw in two laundry detergent pods. I added my light colored laundry to one machine and repeated the process in another machine where I put my light colored laundry. I put fabric softener in the drawer for detergent, bleach and softener and put in enough quarters for the washing machine to run. I chose to wash both dark and light in warm water. When the washing machine were finished, I pulled my light colored laundry out into a cart and rolled a cart to the wall where the dryers are. I shook each piece and sat a few pieces aside that I was going to hang up to dry. After adding the clothing to the dryer, I put several dryer sheets in. I chose to dry at high heat and put in enough quarters for thirty minutes. When I clothes were dry I put all the dry clothes into baskets to take home. When I got home I folded and put away all the dry clothes and hung up wet clothes on a dryer to air dry.</text>

I decided I would like to make a salad for I lunch for I friend and I. I went into the kitchen with some vegetables and washed some vegetables in the sink. Then, I picked out a knife. I quickly sharpened a knife so I could chop up some vegetables without any trouble. I decided to cut some lettuce up first. I chopped some lettuce up into bite sized pieces and put some lettuce into a glass bowl. Then, I quartered a few tomatoes. After I cut a few tomatoes, I sliced the cucumbers after I peeled a few tomatoes. Lastly, I diced an onion. An onion made I eyes water! I was very careful to make sure I did n't cut I when I was chopping some vegetables, and when I was all done, I tossed some vegetables together to make a tasty lunch.</text>

The waiter then left and I took a good look at the food I was allergic to. This dish I ordered was not the same that I asked for. I was allergic to something in the food they brought, but I asked they to take the remade dish out when I ordered so I would not get sick. I waved at The waiter to ask him to come back to I table. I told him politely that the food I was allergic to was not what I had ordered, and asked to have the food I was allergic to remade so that the food I was allergic to would not make I sick. The waiter said The waiter was sorry, and asked the chef to make I dish again without the food I was allergic to. Since a restaurant made a mistake, I did not have to pay for the remade dish.</text>

They wrap around the locker room so there is plenty of room to sit or lay down. A few of I friends are there and They wave to I as I come in and sit down near They. Every one is relaxing quietly in the heat and I am already red and sweating a lot. I sit in there as long as I can stand it, before I leave and jump up and rush out and into the cold water pool they have next to it. It feels so refreshing but I get out before I start getting cold. My skin is red and tingly and I feel great so I head back into the sauna to do it again. I will usually do this a few times before I finally have to go get dressed and head home.</text>

    <text>I flew to Iceland one year on vacation. I left JFK airport in New York and flew to Keflavik in Iceland. JFK is an enormous airport. I parked in long term parking and then took a shuttle to actual terminals. I felt so nervous that I would n't make my flight! I was so afraid beforehand of getting I bag lost that I just packed everything I needed into a small carry on bag. I checked in and then went to security. Security moved along quickly and I was waiting at I gate to catch my flight. JFK airport is pretty gross! While I was waiting, I had a beer at a restaurant. A roach fell on I husband who was with I! We quietly called We server over and she stepped on our server and told We our server happens all the time! We were so disgusted. Our server actually made We want to get on the plane even quicker and get out of there. Finally, We boarded the plane even quicker and were seated next to some nice people from Oregon. We chatted a bit with them and I watched an in-flight movie of Jane Eyre. Finally We got to Iceland. I loved flying!</text>

    <text>When I went to the store the other day, there was a man on the road with bags of fruit. When I was stopped at the light a man on the road with bags of fruit yelled at I window. A man on the road with bags of fruit wanted to know if I wanted to buy the oranges. I decided to buy a bag because they were a good price. When I got home from work, I forgot the oranges in the car for some time. The next day I realized I had left they in the car for some time, and the sun had been on the car for some time. I also realized that the oranges were still in the car. I went out to get the oranges from the car for some time. The oranges were very warm and seemed to have ripened. I decided to make juice out of the oranges, and freeze any I did not use. I took out my blender. I peeled the oranges in batches and placed the oranges in my blender. I blended the oranges with the pulp and all.</text>

    <text>I was riding I bike around I house and noticed I had to peddle harder than I usually do. I got off I bike to see if everything was wrong. The front tire looked okay, the chain was still on the bike, but The front tire was flat unfortunately. I walked I bike back to I house because my bike is not safe to ride a bike with a flat tire. I went in I garage and looked for the air pump. I connected the valve of the air pump to the valve on a flat tire. I pumped the air pump and kept checking the tire to make sure the air pump was working. The air pump was hard work and the air pump took longer than I thought. Eventually, a flat tire seemed full with air. I put I ear next to my ear to see if I could hear any air coming out but I did n't hear any. I got back on I bike and my bike rode fine.</text>

He set it on the stove, then carefully measured out the correct amount of milk, pouring it from the measuring cup into the pan. He turned the burner to medium, then waited. Waiting was the hardest part. He smelled the sickly smell of warming milk as the contents became hotter and hotter. He stirred the sickly smell of warming milk with a wooden spoon, occasionally - just for something to do. He knew the sickly smell of warming milk was n't strictly necessary. He listened to the milk; He could hear the sickly smell of warming milk sort of sizzling along the sides of the pan. He knew from experience that He would n't have long to wait now. Soon, He a the milk at a full boil - the smell was very strong now - and He poured the smell into the mug. Instant hot cocoa was best when you used hot milk.</text>

    <text>I was skimming I Nook for something good to read and found that I had either read everything or that I was not interested in what I had not read. So I decided to go to the local library and get one of the old fashioned paper books that I had not read. I went and looked around the shelves and talked to the librarian and other customers about what was good to read. After picking up a few and reading the summary I finally found one of interest and took the summary to the checkout line. While checking out the book the librarian noticed the handgun on I hip and we had a great conversation about the importance of being ready, willing, and able to protect yourself in any situation and in any locality. She said She was grateful to live in a Nation where we had that right and I heartily agreed with She.</text>

    <text>Since yesterday was Sunday, we did we usual on going out for dinner. About once a month we go to we favorite Chinese Buffet restaurant named LINGS. We finally were getting rain that we need badly, but it was n't too hard. I drove, and it took we about 15 minutes to get there. We walked in and were greeted by the hostess. I guess because of the weather the place was not too busy. We got a booth by the window which is what we always prefer. I husband got his usual starer plate. A big heap of crab legs. I head to the Hibachi bar, because I have to keep an eye on how much sodium I eat. They have a fantastic variety of fresh meats, seafood, and vegetables. I choose all I favorites and then hand his usual starer plate. My husband stir fries I food, hands I I plate, and off I go with tasty hot food. I stopped at one of the other bars and got some white rice to go with some white rice. I then joined I husband. We both enjoyed we meal very much as usual. After his plate of crab legs was finished his then went to the other bars and got more typical style Chinese food. When we were done the waitress brought we check, but by this time the rain really started coming down hard. Everyone in the restaurant waited for the rain to let up before going outside.

    <text>Over the past year, we've had a number of family get-togethers at my house. More often than not, my dad was the one who did the cooking on his barbecue grill. Everyone seemed to really love the cooking, especially when the cooking came off of his barbecue grill. My dad would usually prepare for one of these little barbecue parties a day in advance by making sure that my dad had charcoal and lighter fluid to get his barbecue grill started. Depending on what was being made, my dad would figure out just how much charcoal my dad would need to use, and would lay just how much charcoal out inside his barbecue grill. My dad'd then use paper from the bag of the charcoal, light the paper up, and spray the paper with lighter fluid to ensure that the charcoal caught fire. Once my dad knew that the coals were hot enough, my dad would begin cooking. Whether the coals was burgers, hot dogs, ribs, chicken, or steak, my dad always knew how to grill the paper.</text>

    <text>Earlier today my friend and my went to the the movie theater. Before going, we looked at the tickets online. There was a showing of ``The Mummy ''at 3pm. This was a perfect time for both of we so we booked the tickets. We arrived at the theater 30 minutes early so we would n't be rushed. First we went to the ticket booth to pick up we tickets. We then walked to the concession stand to buy some snacks to eat during the movie. My bought popcorn and coke, while my friend got nachos and a slushee. It was really expensive! After buying we snacks, we decided to go into the theater. Because we were still early, we had no problem finding a seat. Both of we like to sit right in the middle of the theater, because the theater has the best view. The previews started right on time and The previews were really exciting. The movie the movie was just okay, but I still enjoyed the day because of the company of I friend.</text>

    <text>Last time I fed the fish, I was at the river near I boat in New Jersey. As I sat on the back of I boat, I could see some fish jumping out of the water. I ripped up some pieces of bread and started to throw some pieces of bread into the river. As I saw more and more fishes jumping, I continued to throw more food into the water. I could see many fish jumping out of the water and eating more food. My boat in New Jersey was a fun experience and I went through a couple pieces of bread by giving a couple pieces of bread to the fishes. I sister saw I and first questioned what I was doing, but soon after, My sister was helping I feed the fishes as well. I could see more and more fish popping up, awaiting the bread. I did my boat in New Jersey for about ten minutes before stopping and my boat in New Jersey was fun.</text>

    <text>On work days the first thing I do when I wake up is take a shower. Once the water has warmed up I like to stand under the water and enjoy the warmth of the water as the water flows over I. I follow the same routine each day and I start by working a nice lather of the shampoo through the conditioner out of my hair. Once the shampoo is rinsed out I use a liberal amount of the conditioner out and really work a liberal amount of conditioner through the conditioner out of my hair, using I fingers to work out any tangles the conditioner out of my hair has gotten into. While the conditioner out sets I use my favorite tea tree soap and a louffa to get I body clean. Some days I will shave after using my favorite tea tree soap, and then I will brush I teeth before making sure I am all rinsed of my favorite tea tree soap. Now my favorite tea tree soap is time to rinse the conditioner out of my hair and run a comb through the conditioner out of my hair. I usually give I another minute or two to enjoy the warmth of the water before turning off the water and turn I focus to getting dressed and starting I day.</text>

    <text>I bought the tickets with my best friends for a football game at our college in September. As soon as I bought the tickets, I realized that a football game at our college in September was far from where I lived and that I would need to buy a plane ticket since a football game at our college in September was too far to drive my car. I opened up I computer and looked up the name of the airline's I usually fly with. Once I got to the airline's website, I plugged in the departure date and the return date that I needed to be able to go to the game with my best friends. I began looking through the available flight departure times and decided that it would make the most sense for I to fly out at 10:30 in the morning, so I would have enough time to get to the airport. I picked a return flight which landed at 6:30 in the evening so I would have time to get home. After I selected I flights, I went to the purchase page and entered in I credit card information.

    <text>Have you ever had chocolate made from milk and cocoa instead of hot chocolate from a packet and hot water? It is so delicious. First you will need the milk to heat up. The best way to heat the milk to heat up is to bring the milk to heat up to a boil on the stove top. Pour the milk to heat up into a pan and turn the burner on. The burner will cause the milk to heat up and the burner will start to bubble. Once you have rolling bubbles of milk you know the milk to heat up is boiling. Mix in you cocoa and sugar to the bailing mixture. Make sure that the sugar and cocoa dissolve well. Turn off you burner and let stand to cool before pouring into your cup or drinking your cup. The burner is a much tastier way of drinking hot chocolate. Please always ask an adult for help and never turn on or touch a stove without permission.</text>

    <text>I went grocery shopping today. I made a list of things that I needed before I left I house. When I got to the grocery store, I walked in the door and got a shopping cart. The next thing I did was look at my list to see which items I needed to find. My list to see which items I needed to find said I needed to get bread, cheese and milk. First I went to the aisle of bread. There were at least twenty different kinds of bread. I picked out I favorite kind of bread, which is whole wheat, and put my favorite kind of bread, which is whole wheat in a shopping cart. Next I went to the dairy section of the store where I put a gallon of milk and a block of cheese into a shopping cart. I then took a shopping cart up to the front of the store where the cash registers where located. I put I items on one of the counters and a lady scanned each of the counters. A lady told I how much I groceries cost and I gave a lady the money to pay for the counters. A boy took I groceries from the counter and put the counters in a bag. A boy handed I a bag and thanked I for shopping with the counters today. Finally, I left and took I groceries home.</text>

The wait staff was very pleasant and well mannered and this place was a quiet ambient setting. My decided to order My steak, My saw him jot My steak down when My said My steak.

    <text>I love cooking, and my omelettes are I specialty. I usually make my omelettes at least three times a week for breakfast. I kids love my omelettes as well. On Sunday, I decided to try a new recipe for I omelettes. I went to the store, got I ingredients, and brought my ingredients home. I laid everything out on I counter top and got the necessary tools. I cracked the eggs along with a small amount of water into a bowl and beat the eggs until the eggs were all mixed together. Then, I added some salt and pepper to the egg and mixed pepper again. Then, I heated some butter in the entire pan on the stove. Once some butter had melted, I poured in the egg mixture until some butter filled the entire pan. I then added some cheese and bacon bits into the entire pan and mixed the entire pan in. I let the entire pan cook for a while and then flipped a while. Once both sides were sufficiently cooked, I took a while out of the entire pan, put a while on a plate, and ate a while.</text>

    <text>It was a hot summer day when I looked outside and thought I grass was getting a little too long. My neighbor was out mowing My neighbor yard, so I decided to go mow I as well. I put on some old jeans, a tank top and some old, dirty sneakers. I went out to the shed and got my lawn mower out. I put some more gas into my lawn mower and pulled the cord to start the cord. I came to life and I went out the front yard. I was careful to make sure I was mowing in a straight line to make sure I yard would look nice and neat. Then, once the front yard was finished, I mowed the front yard. I put away my lawn mower and took out the weed wacker to get the places my lawn mower just could n't get to.

Then, once I burner had lit, I turned the burner down to a medium high setting to cook some vegetables. I put I pan on top of the burner and put some olive oil in the burner so that the pan and oil would heat up while I was preparing some vegetables.

    <text>The weather was nice today, warm and sunny with no sign of rain, so my best friend and my decided to have a picnic. First, we thought about a good location, and decided to go to a state park not very far away. The park has lots of picnic tables, plus trails for hiking and other activities we could do after eating. Next, my got out my cooler, while my best friend started making The sandwiches. We put some ice in the bottom of the cooler. After that, we put in some bottled water, then potato salad and fruit, stored in their own sturdy plastic containers. The sandwiches went on top, where their would n't get squished by the heavier items. We packed the cooler in the trunk of my car, along with some sunscreen and bug spray, and drove to the state park. We parked near a picnic area and chose a table under a shady tree. While we ate we meal, we watched the wildlife nearby. Squirrels played in a shady tree, birds flew overhead, and a deer cautiously crept out of the woods to graze at the edge of the clearing. When we finished eating, we picked up all of the trash and put all of the trash into a bag. We dumped some ice out of the cooler to make some ice lighter, then put their own sturdy plastic containers inside. We carried the cooler and the trash back to the car and put the trash away before going hiking.</text>

    <text>I am babysitting I newborn nephew while my newborn nephew mother goes to the store. When my newborn nephew cries I know it is only for a few reasons. One of those reasons is that hungry. My newborn nephew gets fed on a schedule, so I know if my newborn nephew starts crying at around 12pm it's because it's time for my newborn nephew bottle. I nephew takes the formula so first I have to mix the formula with water and put the formula in the microwave. Then I have to take the formula out and shake the formula til the formula's well mixed. I test the temperature of the formula on I wrist to make sure the formula's not too hot. Once the formula's at the right temperature I sit down with the baby. I cradle my newborn nephew in I arms and place the bottle in my newborn nephew mouth. My newborn nephew immediately starts drinking. I have to sit until my newborn nephew drinks a certain amount of ounces. When my newborn nephew is done I burp my newborn nephew by placing my newborn nephew on I shoulder and patting my newborn nephew back.</text>

I took a clean filter out of the coffee machine, removed a clean filter, and put a clean filter with fresh ground coffee into a clean filter. Then I placed a clean filter back into the coffee machine. I took the glass carafe from the coffee machine and filled the glass carafe with the water heated up. I then slowly poured the water heated up into the compartment above a clean filter. I turned the coffee machine on and waited as the water heated up. I could smell the aroma of coffee as the water heated up ran over the coffee grounds and dripped fresh, hot coffee into the glass carafe. After a few minutes, I had hot of steaming hot coffee ready to be drunk. I removed the glass carafe and poured coffee into I mug. I added some sugar and cream to flavor the glass carafe how I like to drink the glass carafe.

    <text>Paul walked into the video rental store after a very hard day at work. Paul was angry because Paul had been asked to move areas until next week. Paul had been fond of the job Paul had been doing. Paul did not like Paul new position at all, but no one would listen to Paul. Paul needed to relax, and headed over to the Comedy section in the video rental store. Paul browsed the racks of the one DVD, and finally selected a stand up comedy routine. Paul seemed happy enough. Maybe, I will feel better after I watch Paul, Paul thought. Paul took the empty case to the girl at the counter. The girl asked Paul for his phone number, and Paul quietly rattled his phone number off to The girl. The girl informed Paul that there was money past due on Paul account for past rentals. Paul had only brought enough money for the one DVD. Paul really wanted the one DVD, and told The girl so. The girl agreed to let Paul rent the one DVD, if Paul would pay Paul debt when Paul brought the one DVD back. Paul agreed, and walked the rest of the way home thinking that maybe today was n't such a bad day.</text>

I checked and everything was dry. I started on the bottom rack which was large and small plates and some baking pans by putting away glasses and plastic containers that were washed on the bottom rack which was large and small plates and some baking pans. There were a few glasses that did not wash properly and there was some residue in them so I put some dish soap and hot water in them and sat them in the sink to rinse out later. I then put away everything in the bottom rack which was large and small plates and some baking pans. The last thing I unload is the utensil basket, The last thing I unload is easiest for I to take the whole basket out and hold the whole basket while I put each utensil where the whole basket belongs.

Two days after a job interview, I heard I phone ring. I picked my phone close up and clicked the button to answer. I asked who the person was and what they wanted. My phone close was the secretary from the business and she was asking to schedule another interview for I to meet with her boss. I told she that I would be happy to go meet with her boss again. I asked the woman if she knew what time worked best. She told I that I could come by Friday and that they would have about 30 minutes to talk with I about the job. I agreed and told she that she should have a nice day.</text>

    <text>When I looked out of I window into I back garden I decided I needed a tree to help provide some shade for I dogs while my dogs are outside as it can get very hot where I live. I thought carefully about the type of tree I wanted to grow, I needed something with lots of leaves that would grow quite fast as I could n't afford to buy a tree that was already grown. I did some research on the internet and decided that I would like a Japanese Maple tree with red leaves. I drove to the garden center and made I way to the tree section, where there were lots of lovely small Japanese Maples for sale already growing in pots. I found someone who worked there to advise I on the best way to plant a Japanese Maple tree and how to care for a Japanese Maple tree. After I had paid for a Japanese Maple tree and chosen some special compost for trees, they helped I load the car and I drove home to plant the car. I selected a good spot in my back garden where a good spot would have room to spread out and went into the garage to get I spade. I dug a hole wide and deep enough for the entire pot to fit into, and I laid the entire pot to fit into's side, gently tugging on a Japanese Maple tree to remove the entire pot to fit into from the entire pot to fit into. Once the entire pot to fit into was free, I shook the roots a little to free the roots up and planted a Japanese Maple tree in the hole I had dug. Then I packed the sides of the roots with some special compost for trees, making sure the trunk with my garden hose stayed vertical as I was doing this. When I had finished I watered a Japanese Maple tree really well, making a puddle around the base of the trunk with I garden hose. Then a Japanese Maple tree was time to sit back and imagine in a few years I would have a big leafy red maple providing lots of shade and color.</text>

    <text>Luke was so excited for summer to finally be here. Luke had been waiting all year to do Luke favorite summer activity, camping. Luke and Luke dad decided they would be going to a local state park do some primitive camping. The primitive camping sites were for tents only, and Luke had just gotten a new two person tent for Luke birthday. Dad's called the campground and reserved a site for this evening. Luke was so excited Luke started packing Luke bags. Luke knew Luke'd need Luke tent and sleeping bag, that was a given, but Luke was trying to remember the other things that would be important. Dad's reminded Luke of how bad the bugs were in the woods, and that Luke would want to bring several changes of clothes in case the bugs got wet while fishing. Oh yes, fishing gear, that's what Luke had been forgetting. Luke went to the garage and gathered Luke fishing rod, tackle, and Luke favorite lucky hat in a pile. Dad's packed more practical things like toothbrushes, flashlights, and snacks. Toothbrushes, flashlights, and snacks packed all of the gear in to Dad's truck and took off for toothbrushes, flashlights, and snacks adventure. When toothbrushes, flashlights, and snacks arrived, toothbrushes, flashlights, and snacks paid the park ranger for toothbrushes, flashlights, and snacks camp site, and drove out toward the woods. Toothbrushes, flashlights, and snacks were excited to find a nice flat piece of ground with a fire pit, and lots of trees. This was the beginning of an amazing summer.</text>

    <text>I decided that I wanted to rent a movie instead of seeing something in a movie theater. Because there are n't any video stores around anymore, I checked on I tv to see what was available for I to rent on cable. I also checked to see if there are any Red Boxes in the area where I can rent a DVD for $1.20. I decided to go to a Red Box to get a DVD. I drove to the grocery store down the street and found the Red Box. I used the Red Box to look through the available movies. I sorted the available movies by what came out most recently. Many of the available movies were gone because the available movies were rented by someone else. I finally found one I thought sounded interesting. I selected Hidden Figures because I had not seen Hidden Figures yet. After I made I choice, I used I debit card to pay the $1.20 fee, added I email address to get I receipt, and finished the transaction. A DVD came out of the slot on the machine and I took the machine and drove home.</text>

    <text>Living in old house is not good experience, old house brings depression. So we decided to renovate the rooms. We wanted to start with bedroom, which was most ugliest, specially because it has somehow darkwood color, and it literally looks like dark basement. First of all, we moved our all furniture to other rooms. Cleared up all walls. Then we spread plastic all over the floor, which covered every inch from wall to wall. And taped every inch on walls so every inch does not touch the floor at all. We chose teal color for my bedroom we used sand paper to scrap all walls. Then we used primer first, and primer was white. That is like first coating to wall, so it becomes ready for more coating. Other reason, to condition them prior to actual color. We let it dry for another day. Then we bought teal color from office depot. We had some crushes, rollers, small brushes, wipes, towels. We had ladder. We started ceiling. For ceiling, we chose white color. First we finished with ceiling, then we finished wall one by one using the rollers. It was not an easy task. My arms and shoulders were in pain every night. We gave equal pressure stroke from one direction to other. We finally were finished in 2 days. Then we let it dry for one day, and removed all the plastic, looked for any place that we might have missed. Then we gave fresh look to windows with white color. Finally we were done and brought our all furniture to other rooms in. My bedroom looked like brand new bride.</text>

Me looked down into the fish tank to see that all the fish were making all the fish way from the bottom to the top of the water in order to eat, and when me saw that some fish has swam to a side of the water surface that did not have any food, me sprinkled a little bit of the fish food next on that side so they would not have to fight the other fish for food.

We arranged the chairs and the blanket under the big umbrella, and put on lots of sunblock, so nobody would get a sunburn. I ran to the water and splashed around in the waves.

    <text>Yesterday, my friend and my decided to go to the swimming pool together. The weather was very nice and sunny out, and The weather was quite hot. We decided that The weather was the perfect day to go to the pool. We first packed We bathing suits, our towels, and flip flops. We also packed some waterproof sunscreen and a few snacks -LRB- like chips, pretzels, and juice boxes -RRB-. We took We items to the pool together and dipped We toes into the water. The water was cold and felt really refreshing since the temperature was so hot! We then went fully underwater, which felt amazing. We swam for hours and played pool games, like Marco Polo. We also rented a couple of pool noodles to play with. After swimming for three hours, We decided We were hungry. We got out of the pool and dried off with We towels, then ate a few snacks -LRB- like chips, pretzels, and juice boxes -RRB- We brought. The pool was a fun afternoon at the pool.</text>

    <text>At least 2 times a week we order food from this restaurant. This time we decided to try something new and decided to go for Mexican food. We ordered, chicken enchiladas, chicken chips, crunchy tacos, and some soft tacos and nacho cheese. We put the carry out the order, because the was not far from we house. When I picked the up, I did not check I items. When the arrived. The order was wrong. There were no crunchy tacos, and nacho cheese had pork. I specifically told them that we do not eat pork. Chicken enchiladas were were very dry. Chicken enchiladas was a big disappointment, as Chicken enchiladas was first time we ordered from this restaurant. I was mad. Everyone was so hungry. But no choice. Immediately I called them up and explain the situation. Them were nice, and told I to bring the situation back and them will fix the situation for I. I drove back with my all food, and them made new order and refunded I half of the money and apologized. New order was a mistake, them switched the order. Finally, we got my all food, 1 hour later.</text>

    <text>When you need to go outside the city limits of London, it is best to take the correct train. Cars are a poor choice as Cars hit traffic often, as well as cost money to drive, for me it is far cheaper to take the correct train.

Me made sure to research the time schedule as to find the correct train and time. Me found there was one going when me wanted and it was leaving from Victoria station. Me made sure to get there early so as to purchase a ticket and get a good seat, me do n't like traveling backwards. Having bought me ticket at the counter me walked to the waiting train.

I first had to start the fire and then each of We put marsh mellows in the fire and talked and had a good time. The fire was fun and relaxing and gave all of We the opportunity to sit around in the nice weather. I felt extremely relaxed and was able to share nice discussions with everyone who attended.

    <text>This morning I wanted to make I a big breakfast; so I got out I pan and started heating my pan up on I gas stove. I turned the heat to medium so my pan would be ready when I got I food out the refrigerator. I decided This morning I wanted an omelet and sausage, so I took out the eggs and cracked them into a large bowl. After I whipped them smooth I greased up I pan and poured the eggs in pan. While I let that heat up I pulled out another pan and put another pan on another gas burner. I got out my sausage patties and put my sausage patties in my pan. I eggs were ready to turn so I used I spatula to flip my sausage patties. Now, I sausages were ready to be turned so used I tongs to spin my sausage patties to make sure my sausage patties cooked evenly. After I cooked I food completely I took my sausage patties from my pan and put my sausage patties on a plate. Since I was done cooking I made sure I turned the gas completely off before I enjoyed I breakfast.</text>

    <text>I was watching a cooking show yesterday on television about different recipes for cake mix cakes. I saw a recipe that looked good. I had a Red Velvet chocolate cake mix in a box and the blueberries required. I'm too adventurous for I own good. I figured I'd try a Red Velvet chocolate cake mix in a box and the blueberries required. I tossed the blueberries required with sugar and put the blueberries required in the baking dish. I then mixed butter and a little milk with a Red Velvet chocolate cake mix in a box and the blueberries required. I put a little milk on top of the blueberries required. I put a little milk in the oven. A little milk was supposed to be like a cobbler. The cake was pretty bad. The bottom was all watery and a Red Velvet chocolate cake mix in a box and the blueberries required was super mushy because of all the liquid. The first couple of bites were okay. That was about all anyone could eat. I even tried to get the juice out. I'm tossing the juice this morning.</text>

    <text>When I was younger, I thought that any animal could be considered a pet. I was also scared that I would n't be able to take care of a dog, though, so I constantly asked my parents for all the little fish. I asked for fish because I thought that they would be easy to take care of. When I was about 7 years old, my parents bought a huge aquarium and put a huge aquarium in our living room, and later that the day, our went to the store and picked up some fish to put into a huge aquarium. Since I was the one who wanted all the little fish, my parents gave I the responsibility of feeding my parents. Every now and then during the day, I would take all the little fish flakes that our bought from the same store and sprinkle enough into the tank for all the little fish to eat some. I did this every day that our had that aquarium.</text>

    <text>I decided to make toast for my breakfast this morning, so I opened the bag of sliced bread on the counter and removed one piece. I closed the bag of sliced bread back up using a twist tie and placed the slice of The toast in a slot in the toaster. I plugged in the toaster on the counter, and pushed down the button that activated the toaster. The toast moved down inside the toaster upon pushing the button that activated the toaster and began to cook as the parts inside the toaster heated up and glowed red. I adjusted the knob so that The toast would be perfectly cooked, not burnt, and waited for The toast to pop up. Once The toast was finished, The toast popped up and was hot and crispy. I placed The toast on a plate with rest of my breakfast and got the butter out of the fridge. Using a butter knife, I spread some of the butter out on The toast.</text>

    <text>I arrived at the salon and walked inside. At the front counter was a receptionist who asked me if I had an appointment. I did have an appointment that I scheduled for that day. A receptionist who asked me if I had an appointment let I know that I hairdresser would be ready for I in a few minutes, so I sat down in the lobby and read a magazine for a few minutes. I found a picture of a short hairstyle that I really liked. When I hairdresser came to the lobby to get I, I showed a receptionist who asked me if I had an appointment the picture of the haircut that I wanted. A receptionist who asked me if I had an appointment said that it would be an easy job with my thick hair. I followed a receptionist who asked me if I had an appointment back to the salon area, and a receptionist who asked me if I had an appointment motioned for I to take a seat in a big chair. I sat down, and a receptionist who asked me if I had an appointment put the cape off of me around I shoulders to prevent hair from sticking to I clothes. A receptionist who asked me if I had an appointment brought over a cart with a small tub on a cart, and told I to lean I neck back while a receptionist who asked me if I had an appointment washed my thick hair. After shampooing my thick hair, a receptionist who asked me if I had an appointment rinsed my thick hair out with water and put my thick hair up in a towel to let my thick hair dry. A receptionist who asked me if I had an appointment rolled a cart away and came back with a comb and pair of scissors, and combed through my thick hair. A receptionist who asked me if I had an appointment applied a special creme to I hair to help nourish a special creme, and then started snipping away. Long pieces of my thick hair fell all around I to the floor. A receptionist who asked me if I had an appointment turned I chair around so a receptionist who asked me if I had an appointment could reach my thick hair in the front of I head, and when a receptionist who asked me if I had an appointment was done a receptionist who asked me if I had an appointment washed a receptionist who asked me if I had an appointment scissors off. Then, a receptionist who asked me if I had an appointment dried my thick hair with a blow dryer and the haircut was fully revealed. A receptionist who asked me if I had an appointment took the cape off of me and we chatted for a bit about we days and I thanked a receptionist who asked me if I had an appointment. I returned to the receptionist to pay with I credit card. Then I left.</text>

    <text>As I saw there was only 10 minutes left on the oven timer, the casserole was about to be done. I decided the casserole was time to start setting the dining room table. I wiped the dining room table to make sure it was clean. I got the placemats out of the closet and placed four on the dining room table at each spot. I reached into the kitchen cabinet and got out four large plates, again placing one at each spot. Then oven timer went off, so I got out a trivet and placed a trivet at the center of the dining room table. I then placed the hot casserole dish from the oven on top. I finished setting the dining room table by placing a glass at each place setting. I then counted out four knives, four forks, and four spoons and placed one of each at each place setting. I finally set out a pitcher for drinks and called the family to come eat.</text>

    <text>Today is bathroom cleaning day, said mom as she walked in from work that Friday afternoon. Us kids were hanging out in the living room, one on the computer, another watching TV, another on Us kids phone and I was finishing I school project. We all knew what she meant by bathroom cleaning; that meant We all were going to have clean the whole house staring with the bathrooms. I volunteer to clean the upstairs bathrooms because I know the upstairs bathrooms are the easiest and cleanest to start with. The upstairs bathrooms give I the stink eye, when I walk upstairs to I chore assignment. That's why I am the oldest I whispered to the upstairs bathrooms as I grabbed the cleaning products and smirked when the upstairs bathrooms were salty about the cleaning products. Because the upstairs bathrooms got stuck with the rest of clean the whole house. I headed to the bathroom upstairs and sprayed the tub with the tub cleaner, and I let that soak. I sprayed the toilet with the toilet cleaner and let that soak and sprayed the sink with the disinfectant and let that soak. While everything was soaking I was listen to music. After a few minutes I rinse the tub down and the product did all the work for I, the shower looked good as new. I scrubbed the toilet with the toilet scrubber and the toilet was clean in no time. I wiped down all the surfaces with disinfectant, cleaned the mirrors, took out the trash and sprayed the bathroom with disinfectant. After twenty minutes, I was finished. So I headed to the kitchen for a snack, as the rest of the upstairs bathrooms were still cleaning away. That is why I always clean the upstairs bathrooms on cleaning day.</text>

    <text>Tonight for dinner I decided to make I an omelette to eat. I do n't like a lot of ingredients on I omelette so I just used a few mushrooms and green peppers. I opened a can of mushroom slices and diced a small amount of green peppers and onions very fine. I sprayed I pan with cooking spray and added the the sides. I sauteed the the sides until the the sides were softened. While the the sides were cooking I cracked the runny eggs into a bowl and whipped the the sides with a fork until the the sides were mixed and frothy. When the the sides were softened I dumped the runny eggs into my pan and turned the heat to medium. When I saw the the sides were looking hardened, I carefully lifted one side and turned my pan to the side to let the runny eggs go underneath. After thirty seconds I very carefully flipped the egg mixture and was successful! I added a handful of shredded cheddar cheese and carefully slid my omelette onto a plate where I folded my omelette over. I seasoned with some salt and pepper and my omelette was delicious.</text>

    <text>We went to beach, and one of privilege through club was, We get to pick some DVD's free of charge. So We went to DVD station. We wanted to decide which movie to rent. Now, everybody has different choice. Everybody were new movie releases. Like, Mama a horror film, middle school, The Accountant,, Deep water horizon, come and find me, The whole truth, The girl on the train. All sounded very good, and me know We have one common thing that We all like thriller or comedy movie. So me asked everyone to make one choice out of these 7 movies We selected. So me can make me list to sort it out. It worked, it ended with 2 movies. We all ended up with ''come and find me'' as We watched the main character before in ''Breaking bad''. So me put me rental car in slot, but my rental car did not work first time, so me talked to customer service and then she gave me other card, and my rental car worked, my rental car was good choice.</text>

    <text>Yesterday my wife and my decided to go shop for mattresses. There is a mattress store near where we live with a good selection, so we chose to go there. Upon arriving at a mattress store near where we live with a good selection, we were approached by the salesman, who asked we what we were looking for. We told him how much we hoped to spend and the type of mattress we liked and him showed we to the correct area of a mattress store near where we live with a good selection. As we tried the different mattresses to get a feel of what we liked, we were embarrassed as we three children started jumping from mattress to mattress in excitement. We hurried with we selection to limit the time we kids could horse around. Once we found a good mattress, we talked with the clerk about how to pay for a good mattress, signed the papers and went home. A good mattress will be delivered next week -- yay!</text>

    <text>I placed the laundry basket of freshly washed clothes on the folding table in the laundry room and started in. I first sorted out types of clothes from the laundry basket of freshly washed clothes on the folding table in the laundry room - shirts in one pile, pants in another, and socks and underwear in another. I took a t-shirt out of one pile, flipped one pile over so that the back of the shirt was facing I and laid one pile out flat on the table. I then folded the right arm straight down so that the arm of the shirt faced the middle, then the left side so that the right arm looked like the arms were crossed on the shirt. Next step - carefully folding the bottom upward so that the right arm met the shoulder line. I picked the right arm up, flipped the right arm back over and the shirt was perfectly folded! Boy this task was getting boring - I decided to do the right arm while watching TV and moved the laundry basket of freshly washed clothes on the folding table in the laundry room, and piles of clothing that were already folded to a nice comfy big chair, turned the TV on, found the favorite TV program and plopped down to continue the task of all those clothes. Ahhh much better! Then came a pair of pants which I held up in front of me, folding the side-seems of the legs so that Yaaay met together at the legs. Next, I folded the legs upward so that Yaaay met the top of the waist - perfect! I put the pants in a stack of the same type of clothing that had already been folded and continued getting all those clothes folded and ready to put away. Next came socks, find the mate to the sock needing to be folded, put socks together and take the other sock like Yaaay are making a cuff after Yaaay have put a cuff on Yaaay foot, keep pushing the other sock in so that the other sock looks like Yaaay have a small ball when Yaaay are done. Yaaay, socks are all done, now it's underwear next! I pulled a pair of panties out of the basket, laid a pair of panties out flat and then folded each side so that each side met in the middle, then the bottom so that each side to met in the middle then flipped a pair of panties over, and started a pile of freshly folded underthings. For things like bras, I folded the cups together, the back so that the cups fit inside the cup, and the straps down. Soon with the help of glancing at the favorite TV program, the laundry basket of freshly washed clothes on the folding table in the laundry room was empty, and laundry all folded - yippeeee! What a great idea having something there to entertain a little while working had been.</text>

    <text>The service was terrible, the food was cold and Audrey was overcharged for the meal. This was not the first time that Audrey had experienced these problems at this restaurant. Audrey decided this restaurant was time to write to headquarters, because nothing was being done at store level to resolve these problems. Audrey opened the word processing program on Audrey computer and started a new page. Audrey put Audrey own address and the date in the top right corner and then entered the corporate address of the restaurant below and on the left. Audrey started the letter with `Dear Sir or Madam ', not knowing for sure whether the reader would be a man or a woman. On the next line, Audrey indented and communicated the problems Audrey had on Audrey most recent trip and these problems Audrey had in the past. Audrey explained what Audrey had already said to managers in the restaurant and Audrey disappointment that these problems had not been resolved. Audrey asked that Audrey be contacted in the future. Audrey then signed the letter on the right side with the closing, `Sincerely ', and Audrey name. Audrey printed out the letter and signed under Audrey name and mailed the letter.</text>

    <text>Yesterday, I went to the dentist. I brushed my teeth first, so she would n't think my teeth were crusty. Then I walked to she office, which is only a few blocks from I house. I got there fifteen minutes before I appointment, and told the woman behind the counter I had an appointment with Dr. Le. She smiled and told I to take a seat. I looked at an old magazine while I waited. Soon another woman came and told I another woman were going to take an X-ray. She led I back to a small room. There she put heavy vest on I that was almost like a blanket. Then she put a small film holder in I mouth and told I to hold still. She left the room for a minute, and I think I heard a click, but I did n't feel anything. Then she came back and led I to the dentist's chair. The dentist's smiled, and asked I how I was feeling. Then she told I to open wide, and carefully looked at all my teeth. They were fine! She told I to keep brushing and flossing, and to come back to see she in six months. I was glad to say good-bye.</text>

    <text>One of the activity, that you do in kitchen and will need you most attention is, boiling milk. It does not look like complicated, but needs most attention. You was also ready to do that. You got 2 gallons of milk today and you wanted to make custard today, So you emptied 2 gallons of milk in big pan. You turned on you stove, and put on medium heat and put big pan on. After few minutes, you started to stir 2 gallons of milk, because if you will not stir 2 gallons of milk will start to stick to the bottom, because you milk was very cold when you put 2 gallons of milk in pan. So you stirred 2 gallons of milk often to make sure 2 gallons of milk is not sticking to bottom ONce my milk was warm enough then you stop stirring 2 gallons of milk so much, then you increased more heat. Most important thing at this time, bit to move away from stove to avoid unnecessary big mass. You kept stirring once in while, and with in few minutes, milk started to make bubbling noise. Milk started to boil, and you turned medium heat down, other wise definitely milk was going to overflow. Milk kept boiling and milk reached desired consistency you turned milk off.</text>

A little water is an older stove, so I had to turn on the gas properly and then strike a match to get the flame down started. Once the flame down had started, I turned the flame down to medium and fished a wooden spoon out of the drawer. I stirred the leftover chili every so often in between setting the table and pouring a little water. I had to be careful not to burn the leftover chili; that's what I had done last time. Soon the leftover chili was hot and boiling. I dished the leftover chili out into the bowls and served dinner, making sure I had turned off the gas properly.</text>

    <text>Almost every afternoon, my family and my like to get exercise while also walking our dog. When our first started walking our puppy, he did n't really understand what was going on. It seemed like some days our spent more time almost dragging he instead of he walking along by he. Eventually though he learned that when our grabbed the leash that our store by the front door, that the leash was time to explore the neighborhood together. So now our grab the leash and he comes running. Our attach the leash to he to ensure that he does n't get run off and get into trouble. After our attach the leash, our head outside and begin walking along the sidewalks in the neighborhood. Now that he understands what our are doing, he usually leads the way and there is n't a lot of tugging he along. In addition to a leash, our make sure to bring little baggies with our in case he needs to go to the restroom. If he goes to the restroom in someone else's yard, our make sure that our pick it up and bring it home to throw it in the trash as our want to be a good neighbor. After concluding our walk, our return the leash to the leash place inside the front door so that our will know where to find it next time.</text>

    <text>When I clean the bathroom I start by putting the toilet bowl cleaner in the toilet which I will let sit for a few minutes while I prepare the rest of the bathroom. I will remove the rugs and take the rugs to the deck where I shake the rugs and then hang the rugs to air out. I will scrub the toilet which I will let sit for a few minutes while I prepare the rest of the bathroom, put the brush back in the toilet brush holder and then I will wipe down the rest of the toilet seat and back of the toilet which I will let sit for a few minutes while I prepare the rest of the bathroom, I let the toilet bowl cleaner sit in the toilet bowl without flushing until someone needs to use the bathroom. I will remove everything that is sitting on the sink and wipe that down with the same wipes, when the sink dries I will put everything -LRB- soap, contact solution, toothpaste -RRB- back in order. I will then use Windex to clean the mirrors. I will spray the shower with shower cleaning foam and scrub and rinse that. I then sweep the floor and use a solution of vinegar and hot water to mop the floor. When I am done cleaning I close the door to keep I dogs out and leave the ventilation fan running to dry everything. When the floors are dry I put the rugs back down.</text>

    <text>I usually fold I clothes after I take my clothes out of the dryer. Some people do not, as rumpled casual is OK to wear these days. Folding clothes makes my clothes easier to store in the closet or in a chest of drawers. If you are going to iron my clothes later, my clothes are less rumpled if you have folded my clothes first. If I have all of I clothes in one laundry basket, I usually sort my clothes first. I put my clothes in piles according to clothing type. The surface of a made bed is a good place to fold clothes. I smooth out I socks and put my clothes in pairs, tucking my clothes together at the tops so my clothes stay together. Underwear, both women's and men's I fold at least in half, sometimes in quarters. First I lay the item on a made bed, smooth the fabric so that the item is reasonably flat, then I fold the item into one or two parts. Men's boxer shorts can also be rolled into a sort of a tube shape or sausage. This is still folding them, as This minimizes the wrinkles. I fold T-shirt, after smoothing them out, by folding the sleeves in first, then folding the remaining garment in half and then in quarters. Pants I also lay them flat on a made bed, smooth them out, then fold into quarters. Pants can also be smoothed then rolled with a minimum of wrinkles when you take them out to wear them. I do n't fold a lot of other kinds of clothes, as I husband and I sleep in T-shirts and underwear. After I am done folding the clothes I put them away on a shelf in the closet or in drawers.</text>

    <text>I do laundry once a week, I husband and I do n't make much laundry. First I separate the whites so that the colored clothing does n't make the whites dingy. I fill the washing machine halfway with the colored and a darker clothes or maybe slightly more, making sure the whites are evenly distributed so that the load is not unbalanced. I measure out a half a cap full which is the recommended amount for the type of detergent and machine that I have. I pour the detergent into the specified slot. I close the lid and turn the dial to cold water wash and make sure that the settings are proper. I prefer cold water because the lid's cheaper and does n't fade colors or make dyes bleed. I also set the soil level to high, spin speed to high, and make sure the clothes are spun out twice so that the clothes dry faster in the dryer. I then press start, the washing process will take about an hour. Once the clothes are clean and spun out I deposit the clothes in to the dryer.</text>

    <text>Now that its Summer its time to have a barbecue. I start by cleaning off the top grill, and putting in fresh charcoal and lighting the top grill. While the coals are getting hot I get the hamburgers, the hot dogs, cheese and the toasted buns. Once the coals are red and hot, I put the hamburgers and hotdogs on. The coals sizzle and pop while the coals cook. I roll the hot dogs back and forth with a tong and when the hamburgers are ready I flip the hot dogs over with a spatula. I put cheese on the top of the hot dogs so cheese can melt. I also put the toasted buns on the top grill so the hot dogs can toast. As soon as the hot dogs and cheeseburgers are done, I put the toasted buns on the plates and put the hot dogs and cheeseburgers on the plates. I bring the plates to the picnic table where I family is waiting to put ketchup, mustard, and relish on the plates. We also have French fries, cold slaw, macaroni and cheese and salad to go with cold slaw. Cold slaw a great summer night dinner.</text>

    <text>My family goes around the corner to do the laundry. We do n't have a washing machine, but My mother says the laundromat is more interesting anyway. At home, We organize the light clothes into light and dark colored loads, and sometimes We make a separate load of the delicate things. We stuff the laundry into pillow cases, and each of We carries one. My mother carries a big container of laundry soap too, although laundry soap's possible to buy small packages of soap at the laundromat. Once We get there, We load the light clothes, the light clothes, and the light clothes into separate machines. We set the dials on the front of separate machines to Hot for light-colored clothes, Cold for dark-colored clothes, and Delicate for special things that might tear. Then We put quarters in separate machines, and they start. In less than an hour they are done, and We load they into the huge dryers. Sometimes We put everything in one dryer, except the delicate things.</text>

    <text>I threw a party for New Year's Eve this past year. I invited ten people and had ten people at I apartment. I gathered enough alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks as well as several bags of ice. I bought a few bags of chips, cut veggies and dip. I made buffalo chicken dip, hot crab dip and ordered some pizzas. A friend made some desserts to bring along. We had so much food that I made guests take some along home with guests. The weather was rather warm for December so We were able to hang out on the deck which was fun that We were n't all cooped up inside. A friend brought along a game that We all played and had fun playing. Everyone stayed until midnight when We had a champagne toast to greet the new year. Most people then left to go home but a few friends did opt to sleep over after a party for New Year's Eve ended.</text>

    <text>It's spring time so I decided to plant the young tree. I purchased a small orange tree to go in the back yard. First I dug a hole where I wanted the young tree. Then I shook the roots of the young tree. Then I placed the young tree in a hole. I used a shovel to replace the dirt back over the tree roots. Once satisfied the young tree was firmly in the ground i dragged over the hose. New trees needs lots of water. I watered the young tree until I was satisfied and then put mulch around the base. I also attached ropes to secure the young tree so the young tree would n't fall over while the young tree's roots were still settling in. I also had a canal funnel installed to make sure water went right into the tree roots where water was needed most. Once all was said and done I stepped back to admire I handy work.</text>

    <text>Last week I took a birthday trip with I friends. We were headed to Florida for a long weekend of celebration and beach time. I woke up early for I flight and quickly checked I email. Unfortunately I had an email from the airlines telling I that I original flight was canceled but that I had been placed on a flight an hour earlier! Having my original flight meant I had to leave immediately for the airport. I quickly called a taxi cab and ran outside to wait for a taxi cab. I taxi was delayed but My taxi pulled up about 15 minutes later and I jumped into the back. I explained I situation to the taxi driver and he did he best to bring I to the airport as quickly as possible. We arrived at the airport and I used the machine in the back to pay I fare by credit card. I retrieved I luggage fro the back of My taxi and I was on time for I flight to Florida.</text>

    <text>This morning I decided to make the entire bed after walking up. I first removed all of the sheets, blankets, and pillows from underneath the mattress. I picked up the flat sheet first and spread the flat sheet first on the top of the mattress. I pulled the flat sheet first all the way up to the top of underneath the mattress, and then folded the flat sheet first down about a foot and a half. I also tucked the flat sheet first in underneath the mattress. Once the flat sheet first was even on both sides and smooth, I spread out I blanket on top of the flat sheet first. I again made sure that the flat sheet first was even on both sides. I also placed the two large pillows on the top of the mattress at the head of the entire bed. Lastly, I covered the entire bed and pillows with a large handmade quilt that I grandmother made. I topped a large handmade quilt that my grandmother made with matching decorative pillows placed on top of the two large pillows already at the head of the entire bed.</text>

    <text>I needed a bath. I turned on the cold and hot taps to let the bathtub fill with the warm water. Then I got a towel and draped a towel over the curtain rod. I took off I clothes and grabbed I favorite rubber ducky from a shelf. I dropped him into the tub's. If I needed a bath, so did him. I also poured some bubble bath into the tub's as some bubble bath was filling with water. Some bubble bath foamed up into lots of the bubbles. When the tub's was full enough, I turned off the warm water and got into the tub's, being careful not to slip on the slippery porcelain. I lay back in the warm water and shut I eyes, relaxing. When the warm water started to get cold, I stood up and grabbed a towel from the curtain rod. I draped a towel around I and then opened the tub's drain so the warm water could drain out. I went off to get dressed, and when I was done I went back to the bathroom and turned the shower on for a minute so the bubbles would all go down the tub's drain. I picked up I rubber ducky and gave him a squeeze until him quacked. Then I put him on a shelf until next time.</text>

    <text>I have just moved into a new house, and the walls are white. I think that I would like some more color in a new house, so I decided to paint the walls. I look at lots of different colors I think I would like, and pick out one that looks good. I think about what type of paint I would like too. Some paints are easy to use, but more expensive. Some paints need an extra coat to help cover the whole wall, and can be more work. I go to the store and pick out a good kind of paint in the new color. A good kind of paint is thick and only needs one coat, so a good kind of paint is easy to use. I come home and lay down The blankets I want to paint. The blankets will catch any drops that fall off the brush while I paint, so the floor does not get messy. I dip the brush into the paint and paint the walls, making sure I cover all the white spots. After the walls are covered in the new color, I wait for the paint to dry. Now that the paint is dry, I can touch the walls again and the walls look nicer.</text>

    <text>I like to keep I pets in the house a lot of the time. It's good to keep my pets out of the sun and let my pets spend time around the family. One of the biggest problems, though, is that my pets often shed hair. Just this past weekend, one of I dogs shed a lot of hair on the entire carpet. Since a lot of hair's pet hair, though, a lot of hair takes a few extra steps to clean the entire carpet. The first thing I did was use a special pet hair brush across the carpet to catch as much loose hair as possible. I put as much loose hair into a garbage bag, and threw as much loose hair away. Then, I plugged in I vacuum and went over the entire carpet. After the first round, I went over the entire carpet again with the brush just in case there was any hair left behind. Finally, I vacuumed the entire carpet a second time to clean up as much pet hair, dirt, and trash as possible.</text>

    <text>I was sitting in I living room on the couch when the phone rang. It was loud and had a ringing sound that could be heard everywhere in the house. I thought about who could be calling since a ringing sound that could be heard everywhere in the house was late at night. I did not know many people, and worried that someone had the wrong number. I let the phone ring for a little while thinking about who the phone ring could be, and decided to answer the phone ring. I went over to the phone and picked the phone ring up. I held the phone against I ear and said hello. The person on the other side of the phone said hello also. I did not recognize who the voice belonged to, so I asked who the voice was. They said They were a salesman and wanted to ask I if I would like to buy something. I did not have much money, so I told They I was not interested, and They hung up.</text>

    <text>Before I left to take I trip to the grocery store, I decided to make a shopping list so that I knew exactly what I needed to get and did not forget anything. First, I went to the freezer to see what was inside in terms of meats. When I saw that there were n't any more chicken wings or ground beef, I added more chicken wings to I list. I also considered the meals that I would want to prepare in the upcoming days, and made a notation of the main ingredients I needed for those entr&#233;es that I did not have. I then opened the refrigerator, taking note that there was not any orange juice or milk left, and that the eggs would be empty soon. I completed I list by writing down the vegetables, fruits, beverages and condiments that I saw that were either gone or near empty. Finally, I took note of the vegetables and other canned goods that were in I cabinets, looking to see if I had all of the ingredients needed to make I favorite dishes such as spaghetti, tacos and casseroles. Once I felt I list was complete with all of the necessities, I then filled in the blanks with things that I just simply had a taste for, such as pretzels, popcorn, granola bars and other foods that I were craving for. Now that I shopping list was complete, I read a shopping list over for a final time to make sure there was nothing that I was forgetting once I was satisfied with I list, I placed a shopping list in I purse so that a shopping list will be ready for I trip to the grocery store.</text>

    <text>Monday is the family laundry day where all the clothes are washed, dried and ironed. After picking up all of the clothes in the house, we separate all the clothes from all the clothes. Making various piles of clothes that can fit into the washer and making sure there is enough wash soap we began. Putting the clothes in the washer properly, then the washer time to measure out enough wash soap we began and the fabric softener. The smell of the fabric softener is wonderful. Once all the clothes are dried the washer time to find the iron and ironing board. Turning the iron on to the correct setting I pick up the pair of the pants to iron. Making sure that they are turned outwards, the iron presses a steamy crease down the center of the pants. Have to be careful and not get burned while ironing laundry which can be painful and I have done many times. The iron light comes on that The iron light needs more water for steaming.

    <text>A button had fallen off of my shirt. A button had been loose for a while. The one thread that had held A button had finally given way. I found A button on the floor and put in into I pocket. I got some thread and a needle out of the cabinet. I sat down and placed A button on my shirt and put some thread through a needle out of the cabinet. I took some thread and tied some thread up around a needle out of the cabinet. I slowly passed a needle out of the cabinet with some thread through the button holes and then passed a needle out of the cabinet through my shirt securing A button to the shirt. After I was finished, I knotted off some thread, and I cut some thread. I wound the rest of some thread back on the spool of thread. I took the thread and needle and put the thread and needle back into the cabinet. I was finally able to wear my shirt again.</text>

    <text>One of my family's favorite activities is going shopping, especially since there are so many shopping centers in the area where we live. We visited one just this past weekend. We made sure to dress up nicely, since we were going to be in a public place and did n't want to look badly dressed. One we got there, we did a number of different things. The first thing we did was take my younger brother for a haircut. While my younger brother for a haircut was getting that done, my parents and my went to the food court just across the floor from the barber shop to order some lunch. We saved a plate for my brother for when my younger brother for a haircut was done with my younger brother for a haircut haircut. After my younger brother for a haircut got out and ate, we went around a public place and visited different stores. We visited a pet adoption place just to see the dogs that were there. We also visited a sports store, since my brother and dad are big sports fans. My mom went and visited several women's stores to look for things like clothes and makeup. Once we were done, we left and came back home.</text>

    <text>I had a button pop off of I favorite blue shirt last week. I would n't be able to wear a button pop off of my favorite blue shirt with a button missing; a button pop off of my favorite blue shirt would look rather silly. Luckily, my favorite blue shirt had some extra buttons sewed on the inside. I carefully cut the thread holding on one of some extra buttons sewed on the inside using a pair of scissors. I took a button missing and put a button missing on a sheet of white paper so a button missing would stand out and I would n't lose a button missing. Then I took a needle and the extra thread. I guided the extra thread through the eye of a needle. Once the extra thread was through, I put a button missing against I shirt and went in and out with a needle and thread, alternating which hole I was piercing. I did this many many times, until I was confident a button missing would be on snugly. Then I tied off the thread with a stout knot to keep the thread with a stout knot in place, and cut away the extra thread. I shirt was ready to wear again.</text>

    <text>I began by finding the culprit of my flat tire, my flat tire was a nail on the side of the road. Unfortunately I did not have a spare tire so I had to carry my bike the rest of the way home. After the gruesome trek back to I house I flipped the bicycle upside down and began I repair. First I took off the outer tire to replace the new tube with a better more expensive tube that has the ability to fix a puncture. I do not want to experience carrying my bike a mile ever again. After putting the new tube on I screw back on my flat tire and put my flat tire over a better more expensive tube that has the ability to fix a puncture. I then fill the PSI to 170 in my flat tire and listen for any leaking air. Then I spin my flat tire to make all the slime inside become evenly distributed throughout. This will prevent leaks in the future and even with a slight leak I will still be able to ride back home and fix my flat tire quickly yet again.</text>

    <text>Last year I had to go to I native place in India. While I was there, I thought of meeting one of I friends in Chennai. Chennai is 800 kms far away from I place and Chennai takes about 15 hours if I drive. I decided to take train. I went online and booked The economy tickets. The economy tickets were sold out so I had to book the expensive one. On the day of the travel, I arrived at the train station almost an hour before the actual departure time. Since the train station was a first class ticket, I could take more than enough luggage with I. After 15 minutes in to the journey, the ticket collector came by and checked I tickets. It was early in the morning and I was in a window seat. So I could watch all the scenery. Another good thing about the train is that once in a while I could get up and walk a stretch. Also, when I'm hungry, I could get down at the train station and buy any food as the train stops at the train station. Overall the train station was a wonderful experience.</text>

    <text>We recently decided to renovate our outdated kitchen. We started by gutting our outdated kitchen and removing everything, including cabinets and appliances. We picked out the new modern cabinets, flooring, the counters, and appliances at a few local stores and had the counters delivered to We house. We redid the floors by removing the existing tiles and laying down hardwood flooring. We repainted the walls a pretty light color and installed the new modern cabinets. We had a professional install the counter tops and appliances. We applied a new tile back splash behind the counters and changed out the stainless steel fixtures to a more modern looking stainless steel. We also put new knobs and handles on the cabinets that matched the stainless steel fixtures. We installed new modern pendant lights. We then changed up the decorations. We loved a french farmhouse style, so We decided to put pretty distressed paintings on the walls and fresh flowers on the counters.</text>

    <text>Bella's is a little girl, only three years old. Bella's loves to answer the front door for Bella's mommy. The reason Bella's loves the front door for her mommy so much, is because Bella's is always trying to run and push the doorbell. Bella's likes to hear the doorbell ring through the house. The doorbell ring makes Bella's laugh a lot! So, one day the post man had a package for Bella's mom, and the post man rang the doorbell while they were home.

Bella's was trying to beat Bella's mother there to the front door, and Bella's did! Little Bella's pulled open the door, and peeped outside, Bella's little curls all around Bella's face. ``Yes, who is it? '' Said Bella's. ``I am the postman, where is Bella's mom?

    <text>Facebook decided to have a barbecue to celebrate summer. First, Facebook looked at Facebook schedule and decided the best day to have a barbecue. Facebook decided on the first Saturday in June. Then Facebook talked about who Facebook wanted to invite. Together Facebook decided on about 30 people Facebook would invite, including friends, family, co-workers and co-workers families. Facebook got in touch with co-workers via text, phone and Facebook to let co-workers know about a barbecue and see if co-workers would be able to come. A few people had schedule conflicts but most were free and said that co-workers looked forward to having a cook out. A few days before a barbecue Facebook decided on what Facebook would serve. A few of the guests had offered to bring chips, the salads and beers but Facebook provided most of the food so Facebook made a shopping list of the items Facebook needed. Facebook bought soda, corn on the cob, burgers, buns, chicken, salmon, and ingredients for salad. The day before a barbecue Facebook prepared the salads so the salads would be ready ahead of time. On the day of a barbecue Facebook set up the yard to be ready for Facebook guests. I grilled the meats and corn as everyone mingled and chatted. The weather was great and Facebook all enjoyed the food and had a great time.</text>

    <text>My brother and My renovated the side room last weekend. We first began by taking out all the furniture in the side room. Then, We rolled up the carpets, and put the carpets in the side room. We wanted to paint the walls, so We dropped a drop cloth down to cover the floor. Once the walls were painted, We then waited for the walls to dry, and started to put all the furniture back. But this time, all the furniture We moved to different spots, to redecorate. We made sure that the table was near the window, so that We could see the sun set in the evenings from there. We put the carpets back on the floors again, and vacuumed the carpets and cleaned the carpets. The last thing We did was to make sure that the plants and flowers We had bought were in pretty spots around the side room. We wanted the side room to look fresh and clean.</text>

    <text>After going to the gym, I knew I needed to take a bath. I went to the bathroom and turned the faucet on in the tub while plugging the drain to fill the faucet. When the water to rinse all the shampoo and soap off my body was at a good level I shut the water to rinse all the shampoo and soap off my body off. I took off all I dirty gym clothes. I then made sure the temperature of the water to rinse all the shampoo and soap off my body was nice and warm before I slowly got inside. I soaked in the water to rinse all the shampoo and soap off my body while before I grabbed a bar of soap and scrubbed and cleaned my body with a bar of soap. I also used some shampoo to clean my hair. After dipping into the water to rinse all the shampoo and soap off my body, I unplugged the drain to fill it and emptied the water to rinse all the shampoo and soap off my body from the tub. I got out and dried I with a towel. It sure made I feel a lot better to be clean after a workout.</text>

    <text>This morning I got in my car to go to my job. I looked at my car to go to my job dashboard. I looked at the fuel gauge. The fuel gauge said that I needed gas. The red dial was near E which means empty. I drove to the nearest gas station and pulled up to the gas pump. My gas tank is on the right side of my car to go to my job so I made sure that my car to go to my job was near the pump. I pulled the lever that opens up I gas tank door. I swiped I credit card and selected Regular gas. I lifted the nozzle and carefully inserted the nozzle into My gas tank. I squeezed the valve and waited for My gas tank to fill. After My gas tank was full I carefully replaced the nozzle and put the cap back on My gas tank. I pressed - YES - to receive a receipt of I purchase. I keep records of my car to go to my job gas use with I maintenance records. This helps I to know how well my car to go to my job is working.</text>

    <text>Today I decided to put my old flooring in my bedroom. My had already taken out my old flooring and was just left with a plain, ugly wood floor, called a sub-floor. My cleaned and swept my sub floor and laid down a thin layer of padding that goes underneath my old flooring. My had a package of my long floorboards that my bought at a construction store. My opened up a package of wooden floorboards and took out my long floorboards. My long floorboards fit together with each other, just like a puzzle. My started on one side of my room and laid my long floorboards together, fitting each new piece to the previous piece my had just put down. Sometimes my had to use my hand or a rubber mallet to bang the floorboards together, because my hand was such a tight fit.

    <text>I had to make a salad for a picnic that I wife and I family were going to have. I went into the kitchen and got out a clean cutting board and put the kitchen on the counter. After that, I picked out a knife that would be good for cutting a lot of vegetables. I went into the fridge and got out the carrots, the peppers, avocado, and the lettuce that I would need to cut for a salad. I placed the lettuce on the cutting board and started to chop the lettuce up. I put the finished pieces in a bowl that we would be taking over to the park. I used the knife to cut the peppers and the carrots, too. The finished pieces were put into a bowl, too, so that we could have the finished pieces in a salad, as well.

    <text>I decided that a room in I house should have a different color on a room in my house walls, so I put our new wallpaper on I bedroom walls. To do this, first I three kids and I got in our car and drove to our local home improvements shop, and picked out our new wallpaper. It was fun looking at all the different kinds of wallpaper, and after 10 minutes, our picked out our favorite color and design. Our also got tools and supplies from the home improvement shop that our would need to apply our new wallpaper. Our paid for the wall paper and supplies at the checkout counter before our left the store, then our drove home. Our chose a bright and happy color, with a self sticking back so that our did n't have to use any messy glue to apply any messy glue. First our moved some furniture away from my bedroom walls, and cleaned my bedroom walls with a wet rag, wiping down any dust. Our then applied the wallpaper sheet by sheet, by pulling off the paper backing and pressing our new wallpaper onto the wall, making our new wallpaper as neat and straight as possible. Our new wallpaper was a long job, and took two days to complete, but our took many breaks in between. Our then cleaned up the wallpapering supplies, and left over pieces of wallpaper from some of the strips which our had to cut, and our vacuumed a room in my house so a room in my house would be very clean. Our then moved all the furniture back into place. Our took a good look at our work, and our really like our bright, and happy and freshly wallpapered room.</text>

    <text>We had decided to stay in to prepare something simple for dinner tonight. We had plenty of pasta and spaghetti sauce in the pantry, so this was an obvious choice. We started with the angel hair pasta, since We had several packages of this variety. We started this variety in a large pot, as We had planned on serving several people this evening. Following the short cooking time, We set the angel hair pasta aside to drain. Since We had wanted to spice things up a little beyond the standard pasta dish, We decided that We would add in the pine tree nuts that We had purchased at the local farmers market earlier in the year. I had this very dish at an Italian restaurant one time, and was impressed with the added flavors that the pine nuts had produced. Dinner was quite a success, and the guests all complimented the chef for such a delightful meal.</text>

    <text>With a family of five it seemed like all we ever did was go to the supermarket. Walmart and I built a strong personal relationship. Not only did Walmart and I have household items and clothes that I loved, Walmart and I had food. Every week I spend an hour online printing and sorting I coupons. It is always to good to grab extra deals even if It is just cents off. After compiling I coupons I make my shopping list and break my shopping list down to aisles. It's so amazing that I have been to Walmart so many times that I remember the middle aisles. When I arrive in the food section I start with the middle aisles first and then I work I way around, getting milk last. Sometimes I have to buy so many things that I leave with two or three carts. Grocery shopping is beyond a tedious task that I hate to love.</text>

    <text>When I was feeling hungry last night I decided to make I some soup. I started by picking out which soup I wanted to eat. I also needed to take out a pot to cook the soup in the pot in. After I picked out I can of soup and got I pot out of the cupboard, I needed to get out I can opener so that I could open up the can. I carefully opened up the can to make sure I did n't cut my finger on my finger. Then I poured the soup in the pot can into the cooking pot and threw away the can. Once I had the soup in the pot, I set the soup in the pot on the stove heated up and turned the soup in the pot on. After the stove heated up, I waited for the soup to get hot then turned off the stove heated up and let the pot of soup cool down. Then I got a bowl from I cabinet and a large spoon and filled a bowl with soup and then I was ready to eat!</text>

    <text>I do not like gas stoves. They scare I because of the though of carbon monoxide poisoning. On a gas stove also I find it hard to find the right heat to put the right heat on. But I try I best. I turn a gas stove also on to a medium low heat and find a pot in the cabinet. Once I find a pot in the cabinet I put a pot in the cabinet on the burner that I turned on. I take the food out of the refrigerator that we cooked last night. I end up putting all the left overs in the pot to warm up for I entire family. I watch the food very closely because like I said before, I do n't like cooking on a gas stove. I want to make sure the food does n't burn. I keep stirring the food to make sure the food does n't stick to the pot. Once I think the food is warm I take the food out of a pot in the cabinet and put the food in plates to serve to I family!</text>

    <text>Every week one must do my laundry. It is important to do It to keep your clothes clean so that your do not smell. Doing my laundry is pretty simple. I had to just do laundry in fact! I had to go to the washing machine, put the necessary settings on the washing machine, and wait until the washing machine was finish washing. The washing machine was a boring wait, but I had to wait so that I could put them in the dryer to of course wait some more. This is the easiest way to do This though, I could have hand washed them and hung them up to dry but I bet that takes even longer. This's a pretty boring chore, but one that is necessary. Who wants to be dressed in dirty clothes after all? Anyways, when I was done doing my laundry I went back to I day, happy to have finished a chore!</text>

    <text>As I was driving home last night the car in front of I was weaving all over the road. I was n't sure if they were having a medical emergency or if they were intoxicated or texting and not paying attention so I was scared to try to intervene. I flashed I lights at they hoping to get they attention. They were still driving erratically so I carefully called 911. The operator asked I emergency and I explained that the car in front of I was weaving all over the road. The operator asked where I was and I explained the last exit that I passed and the mile marker at that time. I told her I was headed north and still following the car. The operator said that a cop was very close to I and would be there very soon and asked I to stay on the line until I saw a cop. I saw flashing lights in I mirror and slowed down a bit as a cop passed I. The car in front of me stopped weaving and began slowing down. I told The operator and asked if I should stop to talk with a cop, The operator told I that The operator was n't necessary since a cop was there but asked for I number in case they had any questions as follow up.</text>

    <text>Every morning I take a bath. Before I get into the bath tub, I turn on the hot water. I adjust the cold and the hot water to make a bearable temperature. I adjust the hot water before entering the bath tub so I wo n't burn or freeze I. After the hot water is just right, I take off all I clothes and enter the bath tub. I pour water on I body then I lather up with either soap or shower gel. Once I have soap all over I body, I take I loofah sponge and pour soap on that as well. I, then, begin to scrub I body as firm but gently as I can. I do this to ensure that all the dirt washes off I skin. While I am scrubbing I body, I like to sing in the shower for about twenty minutes. After I scrub really good and finish singing, I pour water continuously on I body until all the soap washes off. I stay in the shower for about twenty minutes until I feel clean.</text>

    <text>I usually wash the dishes once a day. Washing dishes is important, because I only have a certain number of plates and bowls and pots and pans in I cabinets. If I do not wash plates, I do n't have anything to cook or eat on. I washed the dishes last night after I finished with dinner. I had made spaghetti, so I had several things to clean. I rinsed out I bowl and lightly scrubbed my bowl with a sponge before putting my bowl in the dishwasher. I did the same thing with I glass, I utensils, and a plate from lunch that had been left in the sink. I also had a big pot for pasta, a cutting board where I chopped onions, and a saucepan for making the spaghetti sauce. They were too big to fit in the dishwasher, so I had to scrub They with a brush and dish soap very thoroughly. Then I rinsed They out with water and put They on a rack.</text>

    <text>When you wake up in the morning, sometimes you need some help. That's with an alarm clock. Now That may not feel important to you but rather That is when you are a grown up to go to work. Sometimes these things run on batteries and those stop working and you need to change these things out. How to do that is to find the back of the clock. The clock has a little flap with a screw on the back. You get a screw driver and take a screw on the back out. Once you take that out, you would take the little flappy thing out. There you should see those old batteries out! You'll take those old batteries out and put the new ones in exactly how the old ones looked like. If you do n't, it might not work right. Then you go and put the little flappy thing back in and screw the flappy back in and it should work!</text>

    <text>My friends and My decided to take a camping trip, so we looked on the calendar to pick an upcoming weekend that worked well for all of we. Once we had decided on a date, we made a list of all the supplies we would need. We included tents, sleeping bags and pillows, blankets, lanterns, flashlights, bug spray, food and drinks, games to play, a portable radio, changes of clothes, swimsuits, fishing equipment, and dog food -LRB- because we would be bringing one of we friend's dogs with we -RRB-. We gathered all of the supplies together and stored all of the supplies in a friend's garage while awaiting the big weekend. In the meantime, we looked online to confirm the campground we were planning on going to was open and had available space. Everything was confirmed and finally the day of departure arrived. We left for the campground we were planning on going to was open early in the morning so that we could have as much time camping as possible. We arrived at the campgrounds and had a great time all weekend, enjoying each other's company and the great outdoors.</text>

    <text>I was browsing the web and saw an advertisement for a pink dress that I thought looked very pretty and flattering. The web was perfect for an upcoming party that I would be attending. After much deliberation, including reading several reviews, and price checking on other sites, I decided the purchase the item. I added the purchase to I shopping cart online and clicked the button to check out. I was then prompted to enter several pieces of information. First I entered by contact information and address for shipping, making sure to double check that I entered the purchase correctly. I then entered by billing the information by typing I credit card number. Once the information was confirmed on the website, I was prompted to look over I information again before for submitting all of the information. I was emailed a receipt of the purchase and was given information about when I order would ship. I was very excited and happy about I purchase.</text>

    <text>I was really hungry and decided to make some soup. I had to decide what kind to make, so I looked online to find a soup that I had all of the ingredients to make. I found that there was a taco soup that I could make with a bunch of cans of food. I got out a slow cooking machine and plugged a slow cooking machine in. I turned a slow cooking machine on and set a slow cooking machine to cook at a really low temperature. I got out all of the ingredients that were listed in the recipe and opened the cans to get the food out. Once the cans were open, I poured all of the ingredients into a slow cooking machine and added some beef broth to make sure that a slow cooking machine would be a nice, tasty soup. After I set a slow cooking machine to cook for a few hours, a slow cooking machine was ready to eat and we poured a slow cooking machine out.</text>

    <text>This morning was unusually cool, so I decided to take a stroll around I neighborhood. I never know what I might see, so I grabbed I camera. As I was walking, I noticed a beautiful purple and pink butterfly flitting and flying around I neighbor's flowers in her garden. I approached carefully and quietly, but the sweet little butterfly would not stay still. I stood and watched the sweet little butterfly, as I took I camera out of the case. I set the settings where I could get details of the sweet little butterfly, if the sweet little butterfly allowed I to get close enough. Finally, the sweet little butterfly seemed to get used to I presence and started to fly a little slower. The sweet little butterfly settled on the petals of a white flower with a pink center. I raised I camera and looked at the screen. I got a little closer and then zoomed my camera a little more. Snap! I took the photo of the sweet little butterfly. I think he posed for the photo of the sweet little butterfly, as the photo of the sweet little butterfly was perfectly beautiful. I was glad I brought I camera.</text>

I had not spoken to her in a while, however, I enjoyed talking with her. I answered my cell phone with a cheery greeting. We talked for over an hour. Together We discussed how work was going for both of We, and how my mother had been since We talked last. As We shared many laughs, We also talked about important things that had happened since We had seen each other last. We both enjoyed We talk. After noticing it had been a long while, I told her I needed to get ready to make dinner. We hung up after saying We goodbyes and ``I love you's.

    <text>Each morning when I wake up, after dressing one of the first tasks I do is make I bed. First I remove the pillows and blankets. I straighten the fitted sheet which fits around the mattress. Next, I arrange the flat sheet removing all wrinkles and folds, and tuck the loose edges under the mattress. Next I place all the pillow or pillows under the top of the flat sheet. Next I neatly place the blankets on my bed so they are straight and flat. With that done, I put the comforter on top of my bed with the top folded back so the pillows are visible. If the comforter is wash day, I remove all the pillow covers, blankets and sheets and place blankets and sheets in the laundry. Then I get new clean pillow cases, sheets and blankets from the linen closet. I first pit the new pillow cases on the pillows and then follow the procedure described above.</text>

I then turned the key back and held the key back in this position until the car engine started. I then put on and buckled I seatbelt, put I foot on the break, and moved the gear shift to the R, for reverse. I looked into I rearview and side mirrors to make sure that there was no one behind I before backing out. I slowly took I foot off the break and carefully maneuvered out of the driveway using my steering wheel. I then moved the gear shift to D for drive, and released I foot from the break to drive to I destination.</text>

I measured a beautiful painting, then I measured the size of the wall I wanted to put a beautiful painting on. Then I measured the area on the wall I wanted to hang a beautiful painting on. I put tiny pencil marks on the wall to show I where a beautiful painting would be hung. Then I made another small pencil mark to show I where to put a nail in the wall to hang a beautiful painting from. I selected a nail and carefully hammered a nail into the wall to show me where the painting would be hung. Then I hung a beautiful painting on a nail.

    <text>My friend Jack and My went on a camping trip last week. We made sure We brought some fire logs, because We wanted to start a bonfire at night. As the sun was setting, We made sure that We started by collecting the wood together, and putting the wood on the fireplace outside at the campsite. We then took some kindling wood, little strips of wood, and put them in between the logs. A camping trip would help some fire logs to burn well. We also put some paper in between the logs, so that some paper would catch fire too. Once We lit the match, We put the match to the paper and let the match catch fire. The first papers started to burn bright, and some kindling wood, little strips of wood also started to burn. The match caught some fire logs on fire too. We made a big bonfire, but We were careful to be safe too. The match was beautiful!</text>

    <text>Yesterday I noticed that I 10 year old daughter Belle, was n't feeling very well. She seemed to have a fever, so I found the thermometer in the medicine cabinet and checked Belle's temperature. The thermometer was 100 degrees, so I called She Dr. Barnes and he told us to come in as early as possible. Us went down to the garage and got in the car. Us drove to he office on Willow road, and waited there for half an hour. He said that Belle's had the flu and prescribed antibiotics, which luckily taste like strawberry. Us drove to the pharmacy and pick up the medicine. The pharmacist told us to give two teaspoons on the first day, and then one teaspoon daily for 5 days, even if She felt better earlier than the first day. Belle's sat on the first day as I measured with a syringe to take exactly 5ml, just like the instructions specified, and poured onto a spoon. Belle's opened She mouth wide and took a spoon in with the antibiotics and then swallowed a spoon. She liked the taste. I told She She was a good girl and She will start feeling better soon. Us repeated this later than night, and again in the following 4 days, until us were done. Belle's felt much better after 2 days, and now She is back to She old self.</text>

There was a nice spot under a big tree that would give we shade from the sun. We opened up a blanket to sit on and laid a blanket to sit on on the ground. We sat on a blanket to sit on, and placed a basket to carry our food in on top as well. We opened a basket to carry our food in, and took we our food. We each took one water, one banana, one apple, one sandwich and shared the crackers. We sat in the sun and enjoyed our food. When we were done, we laid in the sun to take a nap. After an hour, we woke up and decided to head home. We packed our food back in a basket to carry our food in, folded a blanket to sit on, and carried everything home.</text>

    <text>The last time I made toast, I was really in the mood for toast. I was n't very hungry, but knew that I should eat something small and as a result, I decided to make toast. This was an easy process and began with I taking bread from the top of the refrigerator and putting the refrigerator in the toaster oven. I get the process started by turning on the toaster to where the refrigerator says the toast and letting the bread stay in there until the buzzer goes off. In this particular experience, the refrigerator stayed in the toaster oven for about three minutes before the refrigerator was ready. Once the refrigerator was ready, I grabbed the glove for the heat and used the glove to take out the toast. I then closed the door on the toaster and let the toast sit for a few minutes before eating the door. The door tasted really good and the door was easy to make.</text>

    <text>It's nearly Christmas time, and I've got to wrap up the gifts. When wrapping a gift, you need a gift a gift, some wrapping paper, and lots of tape. First, take some of the wrapping paper from the roll and place the roll on a flat surface. You need to make sure you have enough to completely cover you gift! Then, start wrapping the present. Fold the paper over the top first, then evenly, to make sure the present's box's covered completely. Some gifts are n't in square boxes, so those can be a little tricky to wrap. Wrap the paper over the top first, then fold the sides to make sure everything is nice and even. Then, you tape the paper shut over the box. Once the paper shut over the box's fully taped shut and the paper shut over the box's perfectly even, the paper shut over the box's wrapped! The only thing that's left to do is put the present under the tree to open on Christmas Day.</text>

    <text>Yesterday after a long day of playing at the park, I walked into I house not noticing my muddy shoes were muddy and I was tracking mud all over the whole floor! So first I took off my muddy shoes so that I would not keep getting the whole floor dirty and started getting ready to clean up the mess. First, I went into my closet and grabbed my broom, dustpan, mop, and the bucket of soap and water. Then I headed over to I kitchen sink and filled the bucket of soap and water up with hot water and soap. I started by using I broom to collect the chunks of mud and sweep them into my broom, dustpan and empty them into the garbage can. Then I dipped I mop into the bucket of soap and water and mopped up the whole floor until there was no more mud. I put I cleaning supplies away in my closet and waited twenty minutes for the whole floor to dry so that I would n't slip on the whole floor. After the whole floor dried the whole floor was clean again!</text>

    <text>It was considered a very nice neighborhood. It had police watch, and there was not a single incident that had occurred in this place. So people were at ease. At night, when we were coming back to we house, I heard screaming from a neighbor's house. A neighbor's house was kind of far from a neighbor's house, so a neighbor's house was hard to see what was happening. As soon as I heard the noise, I was in I car, and had almost reached I home, so I immediately drove there, to see if I could help. I saw that there were men trying to break in. I immediately called 911. A neighbor's woke up and a neighbor's asked I, what is happening. So I narrated what I saw, and they asked I if I saw a person's face or anything else. I said no because a person's face was dark, but I saw a car which was parked close a neighbor's house, and a car which was parked close this house was black Chevy truck. They told I police is already dispatched and it is on we way. I was afraid, when I saw They going to They car, so I quickly drove in opposite direction to avoid They.</text>

I grabbed the food scoop from the cat food container and scooped out one scoop of food into the cat dish. The food scoop was a measured scoop, otherwise the cat would eat as much as She wants. I pet She a few times as She charged the bowl to eat. She nearly knocked I over with as fast as She moved, trying to barrel through I.

John rushed to the door but John tripped over one of John shoes that was laying down in the way of the door. John shouted at the door to wait just a moment and pulled John up off the floor. John got up and continued to open the door, out of breath. At the door there was a man John did n't know, the door was the delivery man! John had a package for him that John was waiting for all week. A package for him came early so a package for him made John very excited. John thanked the delivery man and closed the door. John brought a package for him into the house and got one of John box cutters. John opened the box with his box cutters and took out all of the bubble wrap that was placed around the item for protection. A package for him was a new video game that John was excited for! John was so happy a package for him finally came.</text>

    <text>I had a taste for my delicious hot dog for lunch and decided I would make one for I lunch. After getting a pot from the rack and filling a pot with water, I turned on the stove jet to heat and cook my delicious hot dog for lunch until done. I set the stove timer and while I had fifteen minutes to wait on my delicious hot dog for lunch to cook I got out I condiments, ketchup, onions, and mustard. I also put I bun in the toaster oven to warm the hot dog bun and have the hot dog bun ready for my delicious hot dog for lunch. When the stove timer sounded I turned the stove eye off and carefully used tongs to remove my delicious hot dog for lunch from the hot water and placed the hot dog bun in the hot dog bun. Then I put on my condiments that I wanted, got a plate and napkin and set down to enjoy my delicious hot dog for lunch. When I was finished I put I dishes in the dishwasher and I trash in the trashcan.</text>

    <text>I need to wash my hair because my hair's good for my hair to be clean and smell fresh. I turn on the faucet and make the temperature warm and comfortable. I lean my head down into the basin and wet my hair. My hair is long so I make sure to get all of my hair into the basin so my hair gets wet. Then I get the bottle of shampoo. I put all the shampoo into the palm of I hand and rub all the shampoo onto my head. I keep rubbing all the shampoo into my hair until all the shampoo gets sudsy. I am careful not to get all the shampoo into I eyes because all the shampoo might burn. Once all the shampoo has covered my hair, I rinse my hair out in the basin. I make sure that all the shampoo is out of my hair by rinsing a few times. This takes a few minutes. Then I get a towel. I take my head out of the basin and wrap a towel around my hair so I do n't drip water all over the floor. I rub I head with the towel to dry my hair a little. Now I am done washing my hair.</text>

    <text>I am making homemade hot cocoa. The recipe calls for boiled milk, so The recipe will be hot. I will take the milk out of the fridge and carefully measure the milk out of the fridge according to I recipe. I place the milk in the pan and turn the heat on low. I do not want to turn the heat on high, because the heat will heat the milk in the pan too fast and too hot. When milk is heated too fast and too hot, the heat will burn the milk in the pan and curdle the milk in the pan, resulting in the milk loosing the heat creaminess. I will stir the milk in the pan very often in order to keep the milk in the pan from burning and to help the milk in the pan heat evenly. I will keep stirring this way until the milk in the pan starts to boil. I can tell that the milk in the pan is boiling when the milk in the pan starts to form tiny bubbles inside the pan and I can see the milk in the pan boiling. The milk in the pan looks like a fish is underneath the milk in the pan and tiny bubbles inside the pan are from a fish breathing. Yes, I milk is boiling.

    <text>I waited in the airport until the airport was time for the other passengers to board the plane's. I went up with the other passengers and stood in line. We all had to show We boarding passes at the gate. Once We'd done that, We were allowed to board a plane. We all walked down a short hallway that connected the airport to the plane the airport. As We walked in the door of the plane's, a stewardess and a pilot both said hello to We. I walked down the narrow aisle of the plane until I found I seat number, which was near the plane's right wing. I put the bag I was carrying in an overhead compartment near I seat and sat down next to the window. Soon the plane's was taxiing to take off, which means that the plane's was essentially driving to the runway. Once there, the plane's got the go ahead to take off. The plane's started going really, really fast, and then suddenly the plane's was off the ground and quickly gaining elevation. I looked out the window and saw the airport and the neighborhood nearby, the streets and cars and fields all get smaller and smaller, until the streets did n't look real anymore. My flight lasted a few hours. During that time the stewardesses passed around sodas, and people who wanted to eat ordered things like bags of peanuts. I ate a granola bar I'd taken with I and watched part of a movie that they were showing. Finally My flight was time to land. The plane's started to descend, more and more. Finally My flight wheels touched the runway. My flight taxied for a while and then finally came to a stop. People got up and got People bags from the overhead compartments. The narrow aisle of the plane was very crowded at this point. When the doors were opened we all got out of the plane's and made our way to the airport and, from there, to wherever our all were going.</text>

    <text>The last time I cleaned the shower, I felt the need to clean it to scrub and clean the shower thoroughly. I was feeling like the shower was extremely dirty and as a result, I felt the need to clean it. I got out a large amount of cleaning materials and a sponge. I started off by sponging most of the shower and going on I hands and knees. This was tiring and I continued to clean, while spraying cleaner. I then put the bathtub water on and started to scrub more as most of the bathtub water washed away. I could see the dust and dirt going down the drain as I continued to scrub. I then took the shower head and started to spray the shower head all over the shower. As I did this, everything became cleaner and I felt that I cleaning was effective. I enjoyed this experience because I accomplished what I had set out to accomplish.</text>

    <text>Last night I cooked some boneless, skinless tilapia fish for I family. The first thing I had to do was thaw I fish in a bowl of the cool water. I allowed the fish to soak in the cool water for about thirty minutes, and that gave them the proper time to cool. After the fish to soak in the cool water for about thirty minutes, and that gave them the proper time to cool, I patted them dry with a paper towel. I took about one cup of grated parmesan cheese, and one cup of corn meal and some seasoning salt and mixed them together in a large bowl. Then I put my fish filets in another bowl and coated my fish filets with the mayonnaise. While the fish to soak in the cool water for about thirty minutes, and that gave them the proper time to cool were in the mayonnaise, I took a very large frying pan filled half way with canola oil. As canola oil was heating I dipped the mayonnaise coated fish fillets in the cheese corn meal mixture until my fish filets were thoroughly covered. The oil heated quickly and I sprinkled a tiny bit of corn meal in the large pan. Since a tiny bit of corn meal did, I knew a tiny bit of corn meal was time to put the fish to soak in the cool water for about thirty minutes, and that gave them the proper time to cool in the large pan. I placed 5 fillets in the large pan, and they began to quickly sizzle. After about seven minutes, 5 fillets were brown on the other side, and I flipped they to continue cooking on the other side. After another several minutes, the fish to soak in the cool water for about thirty minutes, and that gave them the proper time to cool were crispy and brown on both sides. I checked to see if the fish to soak in the cool water for about thirty minutes, and that gave them the proper time to cool were flaky and done. They were! I called I family to dinner and got the tartar sauce.</text>

    <text>I had bought I dad a tie for father's day. I'm sure I could have given a tie for father's day to him like that, but I thought a nice touch would have been to wrap a tie for father's day. I could n't wrap a tie for father's day like that, so I bought a small cardboard box. A small cardboard box was a bit narrow and the perfect size for a tie. I put a tie for father's day in a small cardboard box and taped a tie for father's day shut. I had bought some blue and white wrapping the paper and some tape, so I set that besides a small cardboard box. I lay a small cardboard box on top of the paper and folded a small cardboard box over. I cut the excess of the paper off and taped the paper to the box. I folded all the sides of the paper to tuck the paper in to a neat package. When I was done, I put a nametag on the paper. I topped off the gift with a small blue ribbon bow.</text>

    <text>When I woke up this morning, I felt really hungry. I went to I refrigerator and opened the door. When I peeked inside, I saw a box of eggs. I took two eggs out of a box of eggs and decided to make two fried eggs. But I felt so hungry that I was worried that two fried eggs would not be enough. I reached into I pantry and found a can of the baked beans. I knew that I had to heat the baked beans on the stove top before I could eat the baked beans though. I took a frying pan and a small sauce pan out of the cupboard. I put both of the baked beans on I stove top and turned the gas from the stove top on low heat. The gas from the stove top came out and began warming a small sauce pan and frying pan. I cracked two fried eggs and put two fried eggs in a frying pan. After some time the gas from the stove top had heated two fried eggs, and I knew that two fried eggs were cooked. I put two fried eggs on the plate besides the eggs. In the meantime, the gas from the stove top had also heated up the baked beans in a small sauce pan. I spooned two fried eggs onto the plate besides two fried eggs and ate I delicious breakfast.</text>

    <text>I had to get up this morning and get the coffee ready. While the coffee was waiting, I fed the cat, and made sure she was n't near the front door, because I did n't want to let she out. The paper out usually came before I woke up anyway, so I did n't have any trouble finding the paper out outside. I saw a light-colored plastic bag, which is usually what they came in, and could see the newspaper through the bag. The newspaper was close to the sidewalk this time, and the day was very sunny. I had to wear sunglasses just to go out for about 30 seconds, because I did n't think I eyes would be able to take the paper out. I was glad when I took the paper out of the bag as I walked inside. It was much drier than the one I had gotten the day before! It's nice to get a paper that is n't soaking wet.</text>

    <text>Yesterday, I went outside to mow the lawn in rows. I first went to the shed where I keep the mower. I opened the door to the shed and got the gasoline can that was in there. I put gas in the mower and then pulled the door out of the shed. To start the mower, I pulled on the cord. I pulled the cord once, twice and then on the third pull the mower started and I was able to begin to mow the lawn in rows. I went back and forth across the lawn in rows. Down one row, turn, back up the next row. I did this many times. Once, there was a tree in the way and I had to go around a tree in the way, but usually a tree in the way was down one row, turn, and back up the next row. The grass being cut smelled very nice and when I was done the yard looked very pretty. Since the sun was hot, I got pretty tired mowing the lawn in rows so after I put the mower back in the shed I went inside to get a drink of water.</text>

    <text>I'm not typically someone who likes, or even frequently irons. However, last week I went out and bought I a pair of linen pants to keep I cool in warmer weather. I did n't realize how easily linen pants wrinkled, and without ironing, linen pants look as if I'm wearing a sack of potatoes. I went down to the basement to dig out I iron and ironing board, I had to rifle through quite a few boxes in order to find the one I had stashed it inside. After I found it, I brought it back upstairs, set up the ironing board to let it heat up, and turned on the iron. I propped it up on the ironing board to let it heat up, and got I pants ready. I tried to remember how to iron, and started with the back of one pants leg, repeated with the other, then ironed the front of linen pants. Within a couple minutes I pants were pressed flat, and looked nice enough to wear for a night out.</text>

    <text>Today is laundry day. Today's a chore that I do every few days. First, I took my clothes hamper and dumped my clothes out in the laundry room. Then, I sorted the laundry room into several piles: whites, darks, colors, delicates and towels. I started the washer up and added the laundry detergent and fabric softener. Then, I added I first load of laundry. While the laundry room was in the washer, I tended to other household chores. When the washing machine buzzed, I knew the washing machine was time to take my clothes out. I took my clothes and put my clothes in the dryer with a dryer sheet. I turned the dryer with a dryer sheet on and then started another load in the washer. When the dryer with a dryer sheet was finished, I emptied the lint trap and took the clothing out and folding the lint trap and put the lint trap away in I closet and in I dresser. I put the clothing that was in the washer into the dryer with a dryer sheet and put in another load of dirty laundry into the washer.</text>

    <text>I went to visit I mom yesterday. I stood in her kitchen talking to her about our weekend plans while her cooked. Her then asked I if I would boil the milk for her, while her was working on other food items in her recipes. I told her I had never boiled milk before, but I am certainly willing to help if her cold give I guidance. Her told I it was easy and that I would be able to do it without any issues. Her told I to get a medium sized sauce pot. Her told I her needed 2 cups of milk. I measured the milk and added the milk the pot. Her told I to turn the heat on medium, so I do not scorch the milk. I heated the milk slowly until the milk began to boil. The milk was admittedly simple, but the milk was a task I had never had to do before.</text>

I then cleared everything out of I hamper and took the laundry basket into the basement. Upon seeing I dad, he told I that he had some laundry to add as well. I took both of our laundry downstairs and placed all of both of our laundry downstairs together into the laundry machine. I step mom told I to separate the colors, but I do not do that. Instead, I placed everything together in together into the laundry machine and the put the laundry detergent in the cup. I pretty much filled the cup up and lathered the cup on top of the clothes.

    <text>My extended family in Utah is planning a reunion in Utah this month. Since we live in West Virginia, it will be a long trip for we. It was too expensive for the five of we to fly, so we planned a three-day road trip instead. We planned for three days of driving each way, with fun things to do on the way to and from we destination. The first night, after ten hours of driving, we will be camping on the banks of the Mississippi River. We have a reserved campsite there. The first night, after driving across Iowa and Nebraska, we will be staying in a motel room. The first night, we will be with my extended family in Utah. We have a time-share condo on a mountain reservoir where we plan to stay for a whole week. We will be hiking, biking, canoeing, playing board games, playing card games, and playing dice games. My hope to have a lot of fun with my extended family in Utah. On the way back to West Virginia, we plan to stop at Zion National Park to hike the legendary Angels' Landing trail. We also plan to stop at Mesa Verde National Park, Carlsbad National Park, and the Jefferson National Expansion Monument. We plan to ride the tram to the top of the Gateway Arch there. My am really excited to get on the road!</text>

    <text>The postman decided to write a letter to the postman aunt, whom the postman had n't seen in a long time. First the postman gathered the postman supplies. The postman picked out a pen, paper, an envelope, my address book, and a postage stamp. After the postman wrote a letter, the postman folded a letter and slid a letter into an envelope. The postman licked the sticky strip on the flap of an envelope and pressed a letter down to seal an envelope. Then the postman wrote my aunt's name and address on the upper left corner. After consulting my address book, the postman wrote my aunt's name and address very neatly in the center of an envelope. The postman checked the addresses again to make sure the addresses were neat and correct, and then the postman affixed a postage stamp to the upper right corner of an envelope. The postman picked up a letter and walked out to the mailbox. After putting a letter in the mailbox, the postman raised the red flag so the postman would know the postman had outgoing mail.</text>

    <text>I wrote a letter to a friend the other day, and then had to mail a letter. Before I could send a letter I needed a few things. I needed the right size envelope, to put a letter in. I needed a stamp, to show I paid for a letter. I went to post office and bought the right size envelope for a letter and the right type of stamp. I wrote I name and address in one corner. I wrote the name and address of the person I was sending a letter too in the middle. Once I had the addresses filled in, I put a letter in the right size envelope. I made sure a letter was sealed in by the sticky glue of the right size envelope. I put a stamp on the outside of the right size envelope, on one corner. I took the right size envelope and walked to the out going mail box at the post office. I dropped a letter into the right box. I left the post office and went home.</text>

    <text>It was early evening, after work but before dinner. I was sitting at home watching TV when I heard a buzzing noise coming from my door. I live by I and was n't expecting anyone, so I was n't sure who would be at my door. I hoped it was n't someone campaigning for some cause or missionaries or anyone else who expected something from I. I paused the television, stood up, and looked through the peep hole in my door. I saw a man standing outside with a package in his hand. I was relieved to know a man standing was just the UPS driver with a package for me. I unlocked my door and opened my door, greeting a man standing outside. He asked I for I name, which I gave He. He handed I a package for me, wished I a good day, and then returned to He truck. I stepped back inside I house, closed my door, and continued with I TV show.</text>

I searched around at several places and found a box that They fit into so I could wrap They easier. I picked our Star Wars wrapping paper to wrap his gift. I put the roller blades in the big box I found and rolled out the wrapping paper to measure how much I would need. I cut more than enough paper to fit the package. I sat a box in the middle of the piece of wrapping paper and folded up the two sides to meet, I put down a piece of tape. I then folded in the other ends to make a V and had the other ends meet in the middle of the piece of wrapping paper, on top of the other tape. I peeled the sticker off the back of a bow and stuck the sticker on top right in the middle of the piece of wrapping paper. I hope he likes he gift!</text>

    <text>Every Saturday morning my mom does laundry. My mom collects all of the clothes from every room in the house. My mom puts the dirty clothes in a big basket. Then, my mom carries a big basket to the laundry room. Inside the laundry room, there is a washing machine that my mom calls the Washer. There is also a drying machine that my mom calls the Dryer. My mom looks through the pile of the white clothes and picks out the clothes that are all white. My mom puts all of the white clothes in one pile, separate from the colorful dirty clothes. For the first load of laundry, my mom always puts in the colorful dirty clothes. My mom says my mom is so the bleach my mom uses when my mom washes the white clothes does not fade the colorful dirty clothes. Once the colorful dirty clothes are in the Washer, my mom takes out the laundry detergent. My mom measures out the exact amount on the box and dumps the exact amount on the box in. Then, my mom turns a washing machine that my mom calls the Washer on and the colorful dirty clothes become soapy and spin around until the colorful dirty clothes are clean. When the washing cycle is done for the colorful dirty clothes, my mom puts the colorful dirty clothes into the Dryer, sets the timer, and shuts the door. When the colorful dirty clothes are dry, my mom takes the colorful dirty clothes out of a washing machine that my mom calls the Washer and folds the colorful dirty clothes.</text>

    <text>The last time that I went to a funeral, I felt really sad. It was for I cousin and I was really sad that we lost him. Upon going to the funeral, I dressed up in an all black suit and drove over to the cemetery. I shook hands and hugged family members and friends, before paying tribute to him in a ceremony. We all stood around him grave site and listened to the priest say what him needed to. Then, we all went around and put some dirt onto the area where the body was buried. A few people stood up and said a few words about I cousin and everyone else talked and grieved together. After saying a few prayers, we all talked for a while and reminisced about I cousin and all of the good things that my cousin did. Finally, after this happened, we left the cemetery.</text>

    <text>Yesterday I was home resting on the couch and I had just woken up from a short nap when the doorbell rang. I was startled because I did not think that anybody was planing to stop by. I rose from the couch and walked over to the door. I looked out of the window before opening the door because I was not expecting anybody. I saw a young man probably in a young man early twenties. I apprehensively opened the door and a young man was very friendly. A young man said that a young man car had broken down around the corner and unfortunately a young man cell phone was out of power and a young man needed to call for help. I decided to help a young man out but of course I did not invite a young man into the house. I grabbed I cell phone and stepped outside. I then handed a young man I phone and allowed a young man to call the tow company for help. A young man then walked off happily to wait for the tow company.</text>

    <text>Last week I realized I needed some new clothes. I decided the shopping centre would have what I would need. I got dressed and put I shoes on. I jumped in the car, buckled up and went to the centre. There were so many stores. I took I time walking around and looking at all the things. I found a dress I liked. I asked the employee if the employee could let I in the dressing room. The employee did and I tried a dress I liked on. A dress I liked was a little too big so I got a smaller size. After paying, I left that store and went looking for shoes to match. I found a cute pair of wedges that fit and bought them. Then, I stopped to grab a bite to eat before loading all of I purchases into the car. I got in I car and went back home to put the stuff away.</text>

    <text>I was very hungry when I woke up in the morning so I went to the kitchen. I took the eggs and bacon out of the refrigerator and pulled my large frying pan out of the cabinet. I coated my large frying pan with a little bit of butter so nothing would stick to the pan, and cracked three eggs into my large frying pan. I stirred three eggs up and added some cheese, salt, and pepper to make scrambled eggs. I let three eggs cook for about five minutes before using a spatula to slide three eggs onto a plate. I then put a few strips of bacon in my large frying pan and fried my large frying pan until my large frying pan was a little crispy. I put a teabag in a cup, and boiled some water in the kettle. Then I poured some water into a cup to make tea. Once everything was done, I took I scrambled eggs, bacon, and tea to the kitchen table to sit down and eat breakfast. It was delicious!</text>

Then, I turn on the water and try to get the water lukewarm so the water's not too hot and not too cold. After I know the water temperature is just right, I put some shampoo onto I hair and start scrubbing some shampoo in. I rinse some shampoo off and start lathering all the soap onto I body. Afterwards, I get the conditioner onto I hair. I stay in the shower, other times I'll do some thinking long enough for all the soap and shampoo to wash off. Sometimes I'll sing in the shower, other times I'll do some thinking.

    <text>As spring rolled around Monica opened the side door of Monica lovely small home in the woods of Pennsylvania. The warm spring air gently caressed Monica cheek all-while the smells from the lovely petunias drifted in from beside Monica. ``Ah petunias, one of my favorite flowers, all the colors it can be! '' Monica moved out from the warm doorway and proceeded to Monica gardening shed where Monica kept all Monica tools. ``For what Monica'm working on today Monica'm going to need some heavy duty stuff. '' Said Monica aloud to Monica. Grabbing the shovel, hoe, and rake Monica walked towards the back part of the yard that was covered in weeds. ``Give Monica 3 weeks and ill have you full of blossoming tomato plants! '' Said Monica to the square patch of land in front of Monica. ``Most people do n't know that the important part of gardening is preparing the soil for the extra plants! '' Over the next 3 hours Monica tirelessly worked to clear the square space of the extra plants and roots and mixed up the soil for the plants and laid seeds. With hard work and care Monica will have tomatoes in no time.</text>

    <text>I decided to ask all my friends to go to dinner with I. Dinner will be at a very nice restaurant. I have to make a reservation because there will be many of us. The restaurant's likes to have notice so the restaurant's can set up a big table for us. I make a list of all the friends I would like to invite. I call all my friends to see who wants to go. Then I find the restaurant's phone number. I call the restaurant's and let them know what day and time and how many of all my friends will be going. Sometimes other people have made reservations also and the day and time I asked for is not available. If that is the case then I ask what day and times are available.

    <text>In coming next week are busy because of guest, marriage and festival. I need to make a shopping list. I brain was overwhelmed with so many things on I mind. In last 2 days, I was writing for things that I am going to need, on I phone, even on refrigerator, on I laptop. I did not want to forget the important thing. So I was writing whenever I was remembering. Finally, I sat at one place without any distraction, and gathered all the things, that I wrote at different place and made a list. I asked I family, if they need something, and then I categorized they, so I can go at a time at one store and get all the things needed from one store, because a list was not just grocery, but from food to clothes, jewelry, toiletry, make up, shoes and home furnishings. So it was very necessary to itemize they to make my shopping easy. Finally, my shopping was done, but always felt like I am missing something,</text>

    <text>I enjoy making the ground coffee so the ground coffee's a fairly complex process but the ground coffee is easy to make coffee. I already have a coffee machine that makes espresso - the dark black coffee - and also steams and froths milk, which is a separate attachment. To prepare for making I coffee, I fill a coffee cup half full of milk. Then I take whole beans and grind whole beans in the grinder, which is very quick. I usually grind two grinders full of beans at once and keep the ground coffee in an airtight container, so I do n't have to grind the ground coffee every time. I take a couple tablespoons of the grinds and put whole beans in the basket that then is inserted into the coffee maker. Next I turn on the coffee maker and when it indicates it's ready, place the mug of milk under a separate attachment and let it froth the milk until it is hot - usually one or two minutes. Finally, I press the button to have hot water run through the ground coffee grinds, running the ground coffee into the mug of frothed milk then turn off a coffee machine that makes espresso - the dark black coffee - and also steams and froths milk, which is a separate attachment and enjoy.</text>

    <text>I wanted to remodel I home. I decided to start with laying new flooring in my living room. I first had to measure how large my living room was. I measured the length of my living room, writing down the size so I would not forget. Then I measured and wrote down the width. I multiplied the two, and found how much area was in my living room. Once I knew that, I knew how much flooring I would need to use. I went to the hardware store and bought the right amount of the old flooring. I removed the old flooring by ripping the old flooring up. I started laying the old flooring as soon as I cleaned out the old. I put the pieces down in sections. Making sure I covered the corners and making sure the angles were straight and all the pieces of flooring fit together. I continued to make sure it all was fitting well until I finished.

    <text>This morning, I went to make coffee in my coffee maker. First I checked to see if the coffee filter still had wet coffee grounds in the coffee filter from yesterday. The coffee filter did, so I took the coffee filter to the sink to wash out the old grounds. Once the coffee filter was clean, I took out a bag of fresh coffee grounds and put two scoops of fresh coffee grounds into the coffee filter. Then I put the coffee filter back into my coffee maker. Next, I took the empty coffee pot from my coffee maker and went back to the sink. I filled the empty coffee pot up with water until the empty coffee pot was at the 8-cups line. I poured all the water in the empty coffee pot into a shaft in my coffee maker. Then I put the empty coffee pot back into my coffee maker. Everything was in position now. The coffee filter contained fresh coffee grounds, my coffee maker had 8 cups of water in the coffee filter, and the empty coffee pot was empty and ready to be filled with the coffee. The only thing left to do was press the on button. After I did that, the coffee began to brew.</text>

I put the fitted sheet on and attached sheet suspenders, sheet seemed to work well. I then sprinkled some baby powder on the fitted sheet because I like the way sheet smells and feels in the bed. I spread the flat sheet out on top of the flat sheet and then the comforter as well. I put two pillows back in their shams and the other two back in their cases.

I then placed the colorful corduroy throw pillows on the bed as well and took a picture because the bed looked so nice and comfy.</text>

    <text>Nowadays, the oranges are always on sale, because the oranges is summer. There are plenty in market. I also bought other day with the intention to make juice out of juice. Fresh and healthy. I bought big bag which has at least 10 oranges in them. I have juicer which squeezes juice perfectly. First, I peeled the oranges. Then I cut the oranges in 4 pieces each. I opened juicer and opened the top. There is little opener in juicer, where you can keep putting the oranges without stopping you mixture. I set up a big container for juice under the juicer, where a big container for juice pours from juicer. I turned o switch, and kept putting orange slices one by one. O switch squeezed the juice and pulp left behind over the blade. After a while, I switched off, because there was so much pulp collected. I cleaned the juice out and again repeated the same process again until the oranges finished. The juice made big jug full of juice. Fresh and clean. Ready to be served.</text>

    <text>Every few weeks, the grass in my yard grows too high and my need to mow my yard to keep my yard looking nice and neat. Yesterday, my had to mow my yard again. Some people have lawn mowers you can sit on and ride, my is a push mower since my lawn is n't very big, and my like the exercise. My checked to make sure there was enough gas in my lawn mower, and pulled the string to start the engine. Being careful, since my lawn mower has very sharp, fast-moving blades underneath, my went in a straight line from one end of my yard to the other. My kept doing that until my yard was completely mowed and all the grass was cut short. After my finished mowing my yard, my made sure to put my lawn mower back in the shed where my lawn mower belonged, and enjoyed a large, cold glass of lemonade, since lawn mowing is hard work.</text>

    <text>I woke late today. I did not do everything that I usually do every morning. One thing that I did not do was make I bed. The first thing I normally do every morning after getting out of bed is make I bed. I wake up, get out of bed and immediately start running I hand across I bed in order to straighten the wrinkles out of I bottom, fitted sheet. When I wake up on time, unlike late today, I then pull up I top, flat sheet and straighten I pillows. Some people tuck Some people top sheet in under the mattress and tuck their top sheet about Some people pillows when Some people make Some people bed. I do n't; I simply pull their top sheet and then the blanket over I pillows and let the sides and bottom of their top sheet hang free. I do n't like feeling all packed into I bed as if my bed was a sleeping bag. Well, tonight that certainly wo n't be an issue since I did n't make I bed at all!</text>

I picked up he little legs and put the changing pad under he. I pulled off he shorts, unsnapped a dirty diaper and removed a dirty diaper.

    <text>I decided that I wanted to cook some pasta so I got a box of the spaghetti noodles out of the cabinets. I got a pot out of the pantry, filled the pantry with the boiling water, then placed the pantry on top of the eye on the stove. Then I turned the knob that controls the heat's on the I and set the temperature to high so that the boiling water will boil. I waited about five minutes into the water began boiling, which is when I took the spaghetti noodles out of a box of spaghetti noodles and immerse the spaghetti noodles in the boiling water. I added a dash of salt to the water to keep the spaghetti noodles from sticking to each other, then with a wooden spoon, I began to gently stir the boiling water, salt and noodles after two minutes of cooking, I repositioned the spaghetti noodles so that the parts that had not been submerged underwater could begin to boil in the boiling water. Once the spaghetti noodles were submerged underwater, then I begin to stir the spaghetti noodles in the boiling water every 30 seconds in order to keep the spaghetti noodles from sticking to the bottom of the sauce pot. I watched as the spaghetti noodles turned from yellow and hard to soft and pale in color. As the spaghetti noodles became more soft, the spaghetti noodles began to bend and curve, which is when I reduced the heat's from high to medium in order to prevent over cooking the spaghetti noodles. After about eight minutes of cooking, I checked the noodle to see if it was hard or soft. Once I saw that the spaghetti noodles were soft enough to be pinched easily, I turned the heat's completely off, remove the sauce pot from the heat's, and drain the boiling water from the spaghetti noodles by emptying the sauce pot into a strainer that is situated inside the sink. After I emptied the pots, and the boiling water, all that is left is the noodles, which are ready to be used in a pasta dish such as spaghetti.</text>

    <text>Every week I have a list a chores that I must do. On Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, I vacuum. Today is Monday, so I knew I would have to get out the vacuum. I went to the hall closet where the vacuum is stored and took out the vacuum cleaner. I plugged the vacuum in. Then, I moved the furniture out of the way and picked up any large pieces of lint or debris. After that, I turned on the vacuum and swept the vacuum over the carpets. I lifted the tables and got every crack and corner of the room. Next, I went to the stairs and unhooked the attachment to the vacuum cleaner that is used for cleaning the stairs. I went up each of the stairs, carefully sucking up all of the dirt that gathered over the weekend. When I was finished, I wound the cord back up and put the vacuum back into the hall closet. I finished by putting all of the furniture back where the cord was before I started cleaning.</text>

    <text>I needed to purchase some supplies for an upcoming trip as well as some pet supplies so rather than wanting to drive to several stores I opted to shop online. I found items that I thought would be perfect so I read reviews of people who had bought items before to see if items were good products or not. After I decided on several things I wanted and added items to I cart, I realized if I added a couple dollars more I would get free shipping so I added some treats for I dogs. I searched google to see if there were any coupon codes for this store and found one that said this store would work. I entered the coupon code and this store did work so I got an additional 10% discount. I entered my shipping address and credit card information and double checked everything in I cart to make sure my shipping address was the items and sizes I wanted.

    <text>Just recently, it was Christmas time. Obviously, with Christmas time comes the task of getting presents for family. This is what I did. I went online and bought the gifts for all of I family members, but of course, I was n't going to just put the gifts under the Christmas tree just like that. I went out and bought some of the nicest looking wrapping paper I could find, along with some tape, bows, name tags, and scissors. Next, I put whichever gifts that were n't already in boxes into some boxes, and I closed some boxes up with tape. The next step was the wrapping. I needed to roll out the right amount of wrapping paper to fit around the box completely, and cut the box loose from the rest of the roll. Then, I needed to fold the corners so there was no loose paper sticking out, and tape the wrapping paper closed. After some boxes were completely wrapped, I put on a name tag for whoever the gift was for, and a bow to top the gift all off.</text>

    <text>This morning I noticed I was out of clean underwear. So I decided to make today laundry day. I went around the house collecting all of the dirty laundry from the laundry room. After collecting today laundry and putting today laundry all in the dirty clothes hamper, I carried today laundry to the laundry room. In the laundry room I sorted the dirty clothes hamper into different piles, darks, whites, towels, and delicates. The first load I needed to wash was the dark clothes. I picked the dirty clothes hamper up and placed the dirty clothes hamper in the washer. Then I closed the washer door. After I heard the latch on the washer door click, I turned on the washing machine. I turned the dial to the ``normal ''setting'' and added the appropriate amount of washing detergent. I also wanted the dirty clothes hamper to be soft, so I added some fabric softener to the wash. After I was done adding the soap, and fabric softener, I pushed the start button.</text>

    <text>I was tidying up I home on a Sunday and decided that our carpet needed to be vacuumed. I went to the closet where our keep our vacuum and pulled our vacuum out to get ready to use our vacuum. I first looked inside the dust filter to make sure that the dust filter was not full. The dust filter was full, so I pulled the dust filter out and emptied the dust filter into the trash can so there would be room in the dust filter. I replaced the dust filter and found an outlet to plug in our vacuum. I turned our vacuum on and began to run our vacuum over our carpet. I did our vacuum in a series of long, parallel strokes so that our carpet would not have any weird patters in our carpet. I made sure to lift up our chairs and had I boyfriend help I by lifting up the couch so I could get underneath. Once the room was vacuumed, I double checked that I had n't missed anything and I unplugged our vacuum. I replaced the cord on our vacuum and put the cord back in the closet where I got the cord out from.</text>

    <text>Taking out the trash was always an everyday chore for me as a kid, and still is today. Me always disliked the trash as a kid, and still do, because almost every time, the garbage smelled awful. Me still always did the trash, though. Otherwise, me knew me would get in trouble with me parents. The first thing me did was tie up the bag. Me would grab two ends of the bag, and tie two ends of the bag into a knot to make sure the bag would n't open. Then, me'd take the garbage outside and throw the garbage outside into the dumpster. Next, me'd go back inside and put new bags in each trash bin inside the house. Me'd take a new bag from a roll that we had in the kitchen or bathroom, depending on which trash bag me was replacing, and put a new bag inside each trash bin inside the house. To make sure that the bag would n't fall in, me would wrap the edges of the bag around the top of each trash bin inside the house and, if possible, tie a small know to secure the bag.</text>

    <text>I bought a painting and decided that I wanted to put a painting up on a wall in my house. I first walked through each room thinking about where a painting would look the best. I considered every wall until I decided on the living room. Every wall was the best place to put every wall because every wall would match the other paintings. I took a measuring tape and a pencil and measured where I wanted a measuring tape on a wall in my house. I made sure a measuring tape was equal lengths from the other paintings on each side. I made a mark with a pencil where the nail should go. I grabbed I toolbox and pulled out I hammer and a nail. I placed the nail on the pencil mark and hammered my toolbox in half way. Then, I took a painting and hung a painting on a wall in my house. I was very happy to see that a painting looked very good! I was happy that I picked that spot.</text>

    <text>Today I decided to have the hot dog around the middle. I looked in I fridge and pulled out the package of hot dogs. I also grabbed the ketchup and mustard to set aside. I pulled one hot dog out of the package of hot dogs and placed the package of hot dogs into my fridge. I took a knife and cut two slits into the hot dog around the middle in order to vent a knife. I then wrapped a knife in a towel, placed a knife on a plate, and put a knife in the microwave. I microwaved a knife for as long as a knife recommended, about a minute. While a knife was microwaving, I got out a hot dog bun and put some ketchup and mustard on some ketchup. When the hot dog around the middle was done microwaving, I pulled some ketchup out, unwrapped some ketchup, and put some ketchup on a hot dog bun. I waited a few minutes to eat some ketchup, as some ketchup was very hot! I then enjoyed some ketchup with a side of chips. Some ketchup was delicious!</text>

    <text>I come home from work and open I door to a messy house. I begin to pick up clothes off of the floor and organize The dirty clothes into clean and dirty piles. The dirty clothes are thrown into the washer with soap and fabric softener, while The dirty clothes are then hung up on hangers in I closet. I notice the bathroom mirror has smudges, and begin to gather the proper cleaning chemicals to wash the bathroom mirror and the rest of the bathroom. I use glass cleaner and paper towels to wipe off the spots on the bathroom mirror, and use bleach in the toilet bowl to disinfect the bathroom mirror. I proceed to clean the rest of the bathroom by vacuuming the floor and wiping off the shower tile with disinfecting wipes. I move on to the bedroom, where I remove the sheets and blankets, as well as pillow cases from the pillows. Once the washer with soap and fabric softener and dryer are finished with I previous load of laundry, I begin to wash I bedding materials.</text>

    <text>I had spilled some soda on I bed, so I had to change I sheets before I went to bed. First I took off I blanket, which was still clean. I set my blanket, which was still clean to the side.

I unfolded the fitted the top sheet first and started in the next corner, getting that corner in place before stretching the top sheet slowly to slip over the next corner, then the next, and then the fourth and final corner. Then I unfolded the top sheet and centered the top sheet on my bed. I tucked the bottom end in under the mattress, making sure that I still had enough on my bed to use at night.

    <text>As an avid mountain biker, I have found I in many precarious situations. From run ins with bears, to falling into prickly bushes. It is always an adventure when you are riding you mountain bike through the great outdoors. One particular issue that affects all mountain bikers, is flat tires. I have had numerous flat tires during I years riding. The first flat tire I ever had left I stranded miles away form civilization. I had to hoof civilization out on foot, carrying a broken bike. Civilization was an experience I did not want to relive again. From then on I purchased and kept many bicycle tire tubes in I riding gear. To replace a bicycle tire is now a simple process for I. You break the bead on the old tire shell and pull the bead slightly to the side. You work the tube out from between the rim and a bicycle tire the tube out from between the rim. You then stuff the new rubber tube where the old one was, making sure the nipple matches with the nipple hole. You then move a bicycle tire back into position and pump up a bicycle tire.</text>

    <text>I only had one light bulb in the two socket fixture on the bathroom ceiling so of course when one light bulb in the two socket fixture blew; one light bulb in the two socket fixture was complete darkness. I grabbed two bulbs from the supply closet and then I dragged a kitchen chair into the bathroom because the step stool was not tall enough for the vaulted ceiling. I propped the door open with a shoe so that some light could get in from the opposing window in the hallway. I stepped up onto a kitchen chair and began to unscrew the glass enclosure exposing one light bulb in the two socket fixture. I gently set the glass covering at I feet on a kitchen chair. I reached up and began unscrewing one light bulb in the two socket fixture. I tossed one light bulb in the two socket fixture can. I grabbed one light bulb that I set on the bathroom counter and screwed one light bulb in, I did the same with one light bulb in the two socket fixture so complete darkness in the bathroom would n't happen again. I then screwed the glass enclosure back on and put a kitchen chair back in the kitchen.</text>

    <text>I looked in my fridge and did not see very much food in my fridge. My fridge was time to go grocery shopping. First though, I needed to make a shopping list. I thought about what I usually have in the fridge and what I liked to eat. I started by writing down the snacks I wanted, since I usually buy snacks when I go out. I checked how much of each food I had left in the cabinet and wrote down things that were almost out. I thought about what was in the freezer. There was not much inside the freezer it looked like, so I wrote down some frozen foods like chicken nuggets. After a while, I had a long list of things that I wanted to buy.

My wife really loves to eat German pancakes, and so I decided that I would wake up early that Sunday and make my wife some food that my wife enjoys. I got a bowl out to mix the ingredients. I put in six or seven eggs, a cup of flour, and a cup of milk to make sure it stayed runny. When I mixed them with a fork, I made sure that all the of the ingredients were mixed together. I got out a pan and started to heat the oven. I melted butter in the glass pan and then poured the ingredients in the glass pan. When the oven was done heating, I put the glass pan in for over ten minutes. After the oven was done, I woke my wife up and we ate the food I made together.</text>

    <text>The other day, I planned for a large family gathering. Since I knew that I house would be crowded with many members of I family and friends, I knew that I would have to both clean and set the dining room table. As a result, I first cleared everything off of the dining room table and found a clean spot for the dining room table. I then cleaned the dining room table and put place settings on the dining room table. I received help from I girlfriend, who brought I the utensils as I placed the utensils on the dining room table. The utensils was an easy experience and I felt like I was able to achieve I goal relatively quickly. Soon after, the dining room table had a placemat, as well as everything that we needed on the dining room table. Everything was clean and looked orderly. I was proud that we were able to set the dining room table and I felt confident that everyone would like the way that the dining room table looked.</text>

    <text>I check out what kind of floor it is. Laminate and hardwood would need a different cleaner than vinyl. I have vinyl floor so I am going to clean all the floor first with a vacuum to get crumbs and other things off all the floor. Then I get a bucket with the clean water and an antibacterial cleaner made for floors. I also have a squeegee the brush with a rectangular yellow sponge. I put the brush in the clean water and them squeeze almost all the water out of the sponge. I then move a rectangular yellow sponge back and forth across all the floor. I often dip a rectangular yellow sponge back in the clean water and squeeze the clean water out again. The dirt is being picked up by a rectangular yellow sponge and I dip a rectangular yellow sponge to wash the dirt off and get clean water on the dirt. With time, though, the clean water is getting dirty from dipping a rectangular yellow sponge in. I keep going over all the floor until all the floor has been wiped with a rectangular yellow sponge. If all the floor is very large I may need to refill the bucket with clean water and cleaner again. I am careful not to step on any floor that is wet from being cleaned. I then give all the floor time to dry before standing on all the floor.</text>

    <text>Today I had to go out and mail a letter. It is something I do not do often, since email makes everything so much more convenient, and also I live in a suburban neighborhood with only a mail slot, where in order to mail a letter I have to go to a post office or find a mail box. Since this Sunday is father's day I decided to do something nice for I dad, and get my dad a card, with a gift card to a bookstore and a handwritten letter inside for a father's day gift. I think my dad will like a handwritten letter the best, because a handwritten letter is something I do not do often, and I told my dad how much my dad means to I and thanked my dad for all my dad did raising I. As a child, I mom was stay-at-home, so I usually spent time with my mom and was closer to my mom than I was I dad. As I've gotten older, I dad and I have bonded over similar hobbies and interests, so by taking a letter, stamping a letter, and dropping a letter off at the local post office, I've kept an old tradition alive, and hopefully given my dad a father's day gift my dad will love.</text>

    <text>Yesterday, I wrote a letter to I friend who lives in Nashville, Tennessee. I used some nice paper, called stationery, and a pen to write a letter. I told I friend lots of things that were happening in I life and invited him to come visit. Once I was finished, I put a letter into an envelope that matched called stationery. I wrote my friend's address in the center of the front side of an envelope that matched the stationery so that the post office would know where to send an envelope that matched the stationery. I wrote my friend's address in the upper left-hand corner just in case a letter should get lost and need to be returned to I. In the upper left-hand corner, I put a postage stamp to pay for the delivery. Once a letter was addressed and stamped, I took a letter outside to I mailbox and put a letter inside. I then raised the flag on the side of the box to alert the mail carrier that there was outgoing mail inside.</text>

    <text>Renting a movie can be fun. Sometimes I know the exact movie I would like to rent, but sometimes I do not. I like to drive to a place where there are many movies available to rent. When I get there I park and go inside. I like walking down the rows. Each row is marked for what kind of movies are in that row like: comedy, drama, horror, classics, Christian, new releases and documentary. Some times there are rows of music videos and other topics. Sometimes I pick more than one movie. I pick more movies if more than one movie is a holiday or long weekend that gives I plenty of time to watch the movies. Next I need to pay the rental fee. I go to the counter. The clerk gives I the total and I pay. The clerk tells I when to return a movie. A few days later I return movie.</text>

    <text>This morning I made toasted bread for I breakfast. I love to eat my wheat bread. I keep my toaster on the kitchen counter.

I do not like a knob that makes the toaster stop when it gets to a certain temperature when I toast is burnt. I could see inside my toaster as the toast out toasted my wheat bread. The elements were getting red. That is the heat that cooks the toast out. All of a sudden my toaster pops the toast out up. All of a sudden the toaster is done! All of a sudden the toaster is hot.

Her asked if I minded if this doctor they asked me print out new patient paperwork brought in a med student who was working with her, I told her it was fine. Her gave I a paper gown to change into and told I to remove everything including socks. This doctor they asked me print out new patient paperwork, med student and physicians assistant all came in and this doctor they asked me print out new patient paperwork checked over I entire body, commenting about freckles but saying everything looked OK.

    <text>I have a very important job interview coming up in a few days and I want to make sure I look I best. I called up I barber and made an appointment for later on in the day. When I got to the barber shop I greeted my barber and took a seat in my barber chair. I told my barber about a very important job interview coming up in a few days and my barber told I not to worry I was in good hands. My barber put the barber apron over I so I would n't get any hair on I clothes while my barber cut I hair. My barber took out my barber scissors and started sniping away like my barber usually did. After about 20 minutes we were all done. My barber took out a small mirror and showed I the front and back of I new haircut. As always I was very satisfied with my barber work. My barber dusted off the loose hair and removed the barber apron as I got up. I paid my barber and gave my barber a nice tip for a job well done. Before leaving my barber wished I good luck on I interview and thanked I for stopping by.</text>

    <text>After sleeping on the same bed sheets for a while, we must wash the same bed sheets for a while. Washing the same bed sheets for a while requires we first to take the same bed sheets for a while. We collect the same bed sheets for a while, then prepare our washer with soap. We put the same bed sheets for a while into our washer, and begin the process of washing. After the same bed sheets for a while are washed, we take the same bed sheets for a while out of our washer and put the same bed sheets for a while into the dryer. After drying the same bed sheets for a while for about 30 minutes, we bring the same bed sheets for a while back into we bedroom. We put on the first sheets, the thin one that we lay on. Next we put the thin sheet that covers we - the one that goes between we and the blanket. Finally, we put the blanket on top. We push all the sides that are hanging off the bed under the mattress.

    <text>Terri unloads the dishwasher every day for Terri mother. Terri knows it is important to keep it free of dishes for the dirty ones to go in. So, after school, Terri unloads any clean dishes Terri mother cleaned earlier, and puts each cup, plate, and dish away neatly. Sometimes there are the other pots as well. Terri takes those out too, and puts those below in the cabinet with the other pots. The last thing Terri does is puts away the silverware. Terri has to be careful with that because of the knives. So, Terri takes each section of silverware carefully, and puts away all the spoons, forks, and knives. When Terri is done with every dish, and it is empty, Terri closes the front door of it and locks it.

Next, I placed the saucepan full of milk on the stove burner, and turned on the stove using the dials. I then watch the milk for indications of boiling.

Larger bubbles start appearing, meaning that the milk for indications of boiling is reaching the boiling temperature, which is 212.3 degrees Fahrenheit for milk. Now that I milk has boiled, I removed the milk for indications of boiling from the stove burner, and continue on to the rest of I recipe.</text>

    <text>I woke up this morning and decided to go get I haircut. I normally go to a place that calls for a phone call in advance of arriving but this time I decided to go to a different place where I could just walk in. When I arrived I had to wait for about 10 minutes before someone could cut I hair, which was alright with I since I did not make an appointment or anything. When I got in the chair the lady cutting I hair asked I what kind of haircut I wanted and I told her short hair on the top with a buzz cut on the sides. Her told I that would be a great look for I and I agreed. During a buzz cut on the sides I talked to the barber about what I did in life and asked her some questions as well. After about 10 minutes her finished the job. I tipped her 5 dollars for her effort and went off satisfied with I haircut. My haircut was a good experience.</text>

    <text>I have a friend that lives far away and I want to send the stamped letter to him. I think about how I can get the stamped letter to him without driving far away. I remember that I can mail the stamped letter. I can pay to have the postal service take the stamped letter and give the stamped letter to I friend for I, which is much easier. I write the stamped letter and find an envelope to fit the stamped letter in. I put the stamped letter inside an envelope to fit the letter in and lick the sticky side of the flap against the envelope. I press down the sticky part of the flap against the envelope to make sure the stamped letter stays safe inside. On the front of an envelope to fit the letter in, I write where a friend that lives far away lives in the center, and where I live in the top left corner. I put a stamp on the top right corner, which shows the postal service that I have paid them. I then drive to the post office and drop the stamped letter into a box where all the letters are picked up and delivered. After a few days, a friend that lives far away gets the stamped letter from a mailman.</text>

    <text>I received a call from my doctor's reminding I that a call was just about time for I annual check-up. I called my doctor's back and scheduled a check-up appointment. On the day of a check-up appointment, I drove to my doctor's office. I walked in, checked in with the receptionist at the front, confirmed I insurance information, and waited for my name to be called. When a nurse called my name to be called, I followed a nurse to the back of the doctor's office where a nurse took my height and weight measurements. After we did my height, we went into the examination room where a nurse took I temperature and blood pressure. A nurse then left, and I waited for my doctor's to come in. When my doctor's came in, a nurse listened to I lungs, examined I throat, nose, and ears, and pressed on the sides of I jaw to check I glands. A nurse asked about any changes in I life and I informed a nurse that nothing had changed in the past year. A nurse said to keep eating healthy and exercising at least three times a week. I left my doctor's office and was happy with I visit.</text>

    <text>Today I want to hardboil two fresh eggs for I lunch. I keep two fresh eggs for my lunch cold in I refrigerator, so I open the refrigerator door and take out two fresh eggs for my lunch. I place two fresh eggs for my lunch on the counter, far back so two fresh eggs for my lunch will not roll off. I find a small pan with a handle and fill a small pan with a half way with the hot water. Then I carefully pick up one egg and place a small pan with a gently in the pan of water. Did I forget the other egg? No, I pick the other egg up next and again put the other egg carefully in the pan of water. Does the hot water cover two fresh eggs for my lunch? Not quite, so I add a little more water until two fresh eggs for my lunch are covered with water. I have my kitchen gas stove. I want to turn on the left front small burner. I know that the left knob on the front of I stove controls the left front small burner. So I turn the left knob on the front of my stove until the left knob on the front of my stove clicks. Then the gas flame lights and is providing heat for I to cook two fresh eggs for my lunch. Next I pick up the pan of water with two eggs in the pan of water. I place the pan on the left front small burner. Now I must watch the pan on the left front burner. I know the hot water must get hot to boil two fresh eggs for my lunch. In fact the hot water must boil with bubbles. Soon the flame under the pan of water makes the hot water hot. When the water boils, then I watch the clock on my kitchen gas stove. After 3 minutes I turn the left knob on the front of my kitchen gas stove to ``off ''and the flame under the pan goes away. Now I let the hot water cool so I will not burn I with the hot water. After about 15 minutes I take a spoon and remove the boiled eggs from the hot water. I put the boiled eggs from the water in a small bowl. The boiled eggs from the water are still in the boiled eggs from the water shells. I decide to put the two boiled eggs back in the refrigerator to get the boiled eggs from the water cold for I lunch. I will eat the boiled eggs from the water when I am hungry. So now you know how I make two hardboiled eggs using I kitchen gas stove.</text>

After finding I favorite section of the library I looked at the titles of the book I wanted and was ready to check out. I picked out a book I thought sounded interesting and read the back cover to make sure the story sounded amusing. After reading the back cover I was excited about the contents of the book I wanted and was ready to check out. I took the book I wanted and was ready to check out to the front of the library where the librarian sat at the librarian desk. I informed the librarian that I found the book I wanted and was ready to check out.

The towels and bathmat smelled like bleach, which reminded I of a swimming pool. After adding a static sheet to the dryer, I closed the door and turned the door on. I dumped the wet clothes from the large plastic basket full of dirty clothes into the washing machine. There were mostly towels, sweatshirts and socks in there, so I decided to use hot water, lots of soap, but no bleach.

I had to wrap a gift for her. So I went and bought a wrapping paper. A wrapping paper was made up of plastic. A wrapping paper was very colorful. I used a pair of scissors and cello tape to stick. I first folded a wrapping paper in two halves and placed a gift for her on top of a gift for her. The ends of the wrapping paper I joined them together with tape. I held the gift horizontal and put tape on the ends. And did the same at the opposite side too. After that I put a sticker on a gift for her along with best wishes and I name.

    <text>I woke up this morning, but I was n't really hungry for breakfast. Still, I knew I needed to eat something for the busy day ahead. I decided that a couple slices of toast would be perfect. I went to the bread box and grabbed a couple of slices out of the loaf of bread. I walked over to the toaster and popped them in. I made sure the settings on the toaster were like I wanted them. I did n't want my toast to be too dark. While I waited for my toast to be too dark to cook, I poured I a glass of juice and took the butter out of the fridge. Soon enough, my toast to be too dark popped up out of the toaster. My toast to be too dark was done. I took a butter knife and spread a little butter over the top of each slice.

    <text>This morning, I was on a hike at our local National park. I stopped to take a break and have a few drinks of water when I saw a bald eagle! It was n't close enough to photograph with my phone camera, so I pulled out my phone camera with a zoom lens. A bald eagle was perched on a tree branch, I think a bald eagle was some kind of pine tree. I zoomed in and got into position to take the photo. I made a little whistle sound, to get the eagle to look in I direction. He looked right at I and I snapped the photo. The sound of I shutter must have spooked He, because He flew away right as I took the shot. That was the first time I've ever seen a bald eagle in the wild, and I was able to get an awesome photo of the shot. I was so happy that I ran right home and shared the picture on social media.</text>

    <text>This afternoon I was sitting in I living room when I heard the doorbell ring. The doorbell ring sounded like high pitched chiming. I was not expecting anyone. When the doorbell ring and I do not know who is at the door when the doorbell rang, I can feel a little nervous or scared. Still, I got up to go answer the door when the doorbell rang and see who was there. When I opened the door when the doorbell rang, I saw that the door when the doorbell rang was the postman who rang the doorbell. I said hello. The postman answered, ``Hello, I have a package for you. Please sign here. '' I signed I signature on his tablet and then took a package for you and said, ``Thank you very much.

    <text>I gather the dirty clothes from the laundry hamper. I sort the dirty clothes from the laundry into blacks, whites, and light and dark colors. This is so the different colors do n't run and stain I clothes while the dirty clothes from the laundry're being washed. I put one pile into the washing machine. I put laundry detergent and fabric softener into the drawer in the front of the washing machine. Fabric softener has separate places where each ones goes. Each ones help clean the dirty clothes from the laundry and make each ones soft. I close the washing machine and choose the right setting by turning the dryer dial. The washing machine starts to wash the dirty clothes from the laundry by filling with water and spinning the dirty clothes from the laundry around. When the washing machine is done the washing machine drains the water and beeps to tell I to take out the dirty clothes from the laundry. I then put the dirty clothes from the laundry in the dryer. I put a dryer sheet in with the wet clothes to make with the wet clothes smell nice and stop with the wet clothes getting stacticky and sticking together. I choose the right setting on the dryer dial, and the right setting on the dryer dial dries the dirty clothes from the laundry by spinning with the wet clothes around and blowing hot air on with the wet clothes. When the dryer is done the dryer beeps for I to talk the dirty clothes from the laundry out. I then fold with the wet clothes and put with the wet clothes away.</text>

    <text>When I go to the park with I dogs I always bring I camera so I can take pictures of my dogs. I like to find a spot with good lighting so I can get the best pictures. Usually depending on what time of day I go, I can find a quiet spot by a tree or by some flowers so I have a nice background. Once I find a good spot I set I camera up on a small tripod. I put I dogs where I want my dogs to sit and focus on my dogs through the view finder. When I have a nicely framed shot I press the capture button and take the picture. I will check the image on the digital camera's screen and make sure the digital camera's a nice photo. If the digital camera's not I will delete the digital camera's and try again. Once I get a few nice shots of I dogs I will set a timer for 10 seconds and go sit with them. When I hear the digital camera's click, I know the picture was taken and I go check the picture. If I like the picture I keep the picture. When I have a lot of nice pictures saved on I camera, we head home from the park.</text>

    <text>My family and My often take trips to the beach. We make sure to wake up really early to get on the road to avoid the traffic that We are sure to hit on a trip to the beach on a hot summer's day. We pack a cooler of sandwiches, waters, and fruit to enjoy while We are there. We also pack some toys for the kids like pails, shovels, and sandcastle molds. We also are sure to pack towels, a big umbrella, and a blanket. When We get there, We are sure to lather up with sunscreen, making sure not to miss a spot. It is so easy to get sunburn when you're out playing on the sand all day. We also lay out We towels and blankets. When We are done with all of that, We take a swim in the ocean. We play games where We try to dive down before the waves. Another fun thing that We do is ride the waves on We boogie boards. With so many fun things to do at the beach, it is no wonder that We are exhausted by the time We leave at the end of the day.</text>

    <text>I went on a hiking trip with a few good friends over the weekend. It was early Sunday morning and I was hoping to get some really good photographs of nature, so I brought along I brand new camera and some extra lenses. Within the first hour of the hike I managed to photograph a couple wild animals, including some really beautiful birds. I also took picture of some of the spectacular wild flowers that grew on the mountain. We hiked for a few hours and at the end of a hiking trip with a few good friends over the weekend I wanted to take a picture to remember what a great time I had. I asked all I friends to line up and then I raised the camera to I face to center the shot. I told a few good friends over the weekend on the count of three to say cheese and then I pressed to shutter button to forever capture this wonderful moment.</text>

I do n't want to turn the heat up to high because I do n't want the heat to boil too fast. I put some milk back into the refrigerator as I wait for the milk to boil. I watch for small bubbles to appear, which shows some milk is boiling. This takes about 5 minutes for the milk to get hot enough and boil. Once I see many small bubbles in some milk, I turn the stove off. I know some milk has finished boiling and take some milk off the heat.</text>

    <text>As I was heading to work yesterday I looked down and I realized that my new shoes were looking a bit scuffed. I decided then that I needed to buy some new work shoes for every day wear. I had recently taken a trip with my friends and remembered that I had admired a pair of shoes that one of my friends had. When I arrived at work I emailed her to ask her where her had purchased my new shoes and her told I they are from amazon. I immediately accessed amazon and searched for my new shoes. There were a number of different options but I picked the style that I liked and luckily the size I wanted was in stock. I ordered my new shoes immediately and because I have amazon prime my new shoes will arrive in two days. I am excited for my new shoes be delivered and I really hope that they fit fine.</text>

    <text>Often, I find I in need of a different, or new item. Usually, one of the best ways to find something, is to shop online. With the summer coming, and a toddler who does n't know how to swim, I decided to buy him a life jacket the other day. I went on to Amazon, and searched life jackets for toddlers. So many results came up, and I was able to sort by good reviews, and if many results have Prime shipping. Many results limited the search to a few good items, and I clicked on one with arm bands and a picture of a shark on many results. Alex likes sharks, and just began making shark noises, which involving Alex making a chomping sound. The reviews were all good, and a life jacket was Alex correct size, so I added a life jacket to I online shopping cart. I already had a credit card and address on file, so I clicked pay now, and within two days pay was on I front porch. Alex is excited and ready for safe swimming.</text>

    <text>I went to get dressed this morning. There was nothing to wear. All I clothes were dirty! I knew I finally needed to do the laundry room. I gathered up all the dirty clothes and put all the dirty clothes in the basket. I brought the basket into the laundry room. Once in the laundry room, I sorted out the clothing. I put one batch of clothing in the washer with the detergent. The detergent took a while, but finally all the dirty clothes were clean. The detergent was time to dry all the dirty clothes. I put all the dirty clothes into the dryer and I loaded another batch in the washer with the detergent. I waited for all the dirty clothes to wash and dry. When all the dirty clothes finished drying, I began to fold all the dirty clothes. Some of all the dirty clothes needed to be hung up.

    <text>As a new Yorker I take the underground, or subway, every day to get two and from work. I always make sure to have I metrocard in I wallet, so if I ever need the subway I can always get on it. I have many station locations memorized, but every now and then I need to consult a map to figure out where to go and where the closest station is. Once I know I walk towards the closest station, looking for the green globes on top of poles that indicate the station stairs are there and I can enter. Sometimes I hear a subway roaring through the tunnels and I hurry down the steps to see if its my train. Instead I see the express train speeding along the center track, because I am at a local stop and still have to wait for its my train. At the turnstile I swipe I card through the magnetic reader and the turnstile chimes and a green led light flashes go, and I can walk through the turnstile and onto the platform. Once there I look down the tunnel and see the yellow glow of two train head lights. Its my train is almost here so I step back and away from the edge and watch as its my train pulls in, slowing down and stopping completely in the closest station. Then I an all the other people pile in through the double doors. There are enough seats so I sit down and the conductor announces the next stop, before through the double doors closing noise signals and through the double doors close shut. We are soon speeding along, stopping at each stop to let people on and off. Finally getting to I stop I get up and exit though another turnstile and take the station stairs up and into a different neighborhood in the city. The underground subway is so easy and fast, The underground subway the best way to get around and once you know how, you can go anywhere in the city.</text>

    <text>This morning for breakfast I started by making coffee. I threw the filter with used grounds from yesterday into the trash and put a new filter in the basket, I measured out five tablespoons of coffee into a new filter and five cups of water which I dumped into the water reservoir and turned the coffee maker on. I decided I wanted to eat oatmeal and peanut butter toast. I dumped a package of apple cinnamon oatmeal into a bowl and added enough water to cover a package of apple cinnamon oatmeal into a bowl, stirred a package of apple cinnamon oatmeal into a bowl and put a package of apple cinnamon oatmeal into a bowl in the microwave for two minutes to cook. I put two pieces of Italian bread into a new filter and toasted two pieces of Italian bread. When the toast was done, I put peanut butter on both slices. I removed apple cinnamon oatmeal into a bowl from the microwave for two minutes and apple cinnamon oatmeal into a bowl was perfectly thick like I like apple cinnamon oatmeal into a bowl.

We carried a large popcorn to the entrance of the theater, and handed We tickets to the collector, who directed We to the second theater on We right.

The most of the dirty spots were disappearing. There were some rusting spot, I did not know what to do. I tried 409 and somehow bathroom worked. The dirty spots were very stubborn. The faucet in shower looked so dull, so I applied normal detergent liquid and The faucet in shower worked very well.

Then Henry goes into the bathroom, to see what Henry needs to refill, and adds those to Henry list as well. By the time Henry has gone through the house, Henry has several things on the whole list, checking things off as he goes. Henry takes the whole list, checking things off as he goes to the grocery store, and goes through the whole list, checking things off as he goes. When Henry has all the list in Henry basket, Henry then buys everything Henry found, and brings the whole list, checking things off as he goes back to Henry home. Henry is happy that Henry made the whole list, checking things off as he goes, because Henry did not forget anything that Henry really needed to get and replace. The whole list, checking things off as he goes also helps Henry save money by not getting things Henry does not need.</text>

    <text>The last time that I folded the clothes, I did so in I room. My room was an easy and relaxing process, but since I had a large load of clothes to fold, my room was somewhat time consuming. I went through every piece of clothing and folded every piece of clothing in a similar and orderly fashion. While I folded the clothes, I put each one down next to I and watched the TV. Upon finishing this activity, I put some clothes in the drawer and I hung other articles of clothing up. I felt that I room seemed much more cleaner and I felt accomplished. Everything was in the place that my room belonged and everything was dry and clean. This process was easy, but This process did take a large amount of time due to the large amount of clothes that I had to fold. I should have taken This process little by little instead of doing every piece of clothing all at once.</text>

    <text>It was an early Saturday morning so I decided to mow the front lawn. The grass in rows was getting really tall because the grass in rows was spring. I changed into outside clothes and put on I hat and sunscreen, because my hat was a hot day. I went outside and got I mower from the garage. My hat did not have any gas, so I filled up the gas tank. I started my mower. Then I started with the front lawn. I pushed my mower and started to mow the front lawn. I mowed the grass in rows, to make sure I did n't miss any grass. I went around the trees and by the road. After I was done with the front, I went to the back yard. I mowed all of the grass in rows, making sure to not mow the flowers.

    <text>Yesterday, I went to a fast food restaurant. There is a new chain that opened across the street from I house and so I wanted to try them. Overall, a new chain that opened across the street from my house and so I wanted to try them was nice. I walked inside and the place was clean, upkept, and I was greeted by the employees there who said hello to I. I took time to then study the menu - it was colorful but easy to read and I quickly decided what I wanted to eat. When I got to the register I gave the woman working there I order and paid, the woman gave I a ticket and said the meal would be right out. A ticket was out a couple minutes later. A ticket was very good, I got a burger and fries and a burger and fries were both cooked well. I ate I food, threw I trash out, and left, with the employees wishing I a good day.

    <text>I do n't usually mail letters, but there's is something that says ``I care ''more than an email, text message or, Facebook interaction. I went to the store to buy some nice stationary paper, colorful pens and envelopes. I then walked over to the post office and purchased some forever stamps with cute kittens on colorful pens. I knew I grammy would like colorful pens because my grammy loves cats. I wrote my grammy a letter just telling her I love my grammy and told my grammy things about her grand kids that would make her proud. Once I had written about a page I folded a letter just telling her into thirds so that a letter just telling her would fit perfectly into the envelope in the upper right corn. I also enclosed some photographs of her grand kids that would make her proud and a picture each of her grand kids that would make her proud drew. I licked and sealed the envelope in the upper right corn and applied a stamp to the front of the envelope in the upper right corn. I wrote my grammy name and address front and center and I own in the top left corner. I drove to the nearest postal drop box and deposited a letter just telling her.</text>

    <text>John and Jerry love camping with the boys family. The boys are brothers, and when their dad takes the boys camping, the boys get so happy! Their dad took the boys on a trip a month ago, to a campground in the mountains. It was very pretty, and It even had a place to park your camper, and set up your tents. In the camp sites there was a little fire pit to make a fire on at night, and to cook with. When the boys got to the camp site, the boys made sure the boys set up your tents first. Then the boys set up a fire, and put the coffee maker, and the food pots near a fire when the boys would use the boys for dinner. Their dad always brings enough food, and their dad brings a treat too. Usually, their dad brings smores to the camp site for the boys to make on a fire after dinner. Before dinner, the boys usually play outside at the campground with other kids, but when their dad calls the boys for dinner, the boys run back for dinner and smores!</text>

    <text>In the summer a camping trip is fun. I went with I niece and nephew to a state park for two days. First, we packed clothes, extra shoes, food, soap and toothpaste with toothbrushes. We also packed we tents, sleeping bags, and flashlights. Once we were all packed up we were read to go! We drove to the park and got we tents set up. They popped up easily and we staked They down carefully. Now we could enjoy the park. We hiked down to the river. An eagle soared above. After taking off we shoes and socks we hopped across from rock to rock. We grilled burgers and corn on the cob. Later in the evening we toasted marshmallows on crackers with chocolates. Of course, we told ghost stories by flashlight before going to sleep. The next morning, we enjoyed a hike, where we got to see a deer and lots of birds, then packed up and went home.</text>

    <text>Last week it snowed for the first time this winter. I decided to celebrate the snow by making some hot chocolate. In order to make I hot chocolate, I needed to first boil milk. In order to boil the milk, I first turned on I stove top and set the temperature to high. I then took out a saucepan and put a saucepan over the heat. Next, I went to I refrigerator. I took a half-gallon carton of milk out of the refrigerator. I put a half-gallon carton of milk counter, and then got out I measuring cups. I needed about two cups of milk to make I hot chocolate, so I poured and measured two cups of milk. I added the milk to the saucepan and covered a saucepan with a lid. I then returned a half-gallon carton of milk to the refrigerator. I kept a close eye on a saucepan until the milk started to boil. When the milk reached boiling point, the milk started to bubble. I removed a saucepan from the heat at boiling point.</text>

    <text>I traveled some by underground train while living in the San Francisco area. I lived across the bay and took underground train to get there. I and I girlfriend went to the station, it is called BART to stand for ``Bay Area Rapid Transit '', and paid a person at a counter to obtain a pass good for everywhere you want to go that day. Then we walked through the turnstiles and went down an escalator to the platform where underground train pulls in. We waited about five or ten minutes and underground train came whooshing in through the big tunnel. The sliding doors opened, people came out and we got on. The ride was very smooth, but sometimes The ride wobbled a bit. Thankfully there are posts and railings to hold on to. The ride took we to we destination, where we got off at a similar platform and went up an escalator. At the end of the day we took an escalator back.</text>

    <text>My daughter and My took a road trip to Kearney, Nebraska. We had no set plan for the day. We were there just to see what all was there. We stopped into the Vistor's Center and found a lot of information about what there was to visit in Kearney. My daughter's favorite place turned out to be the art museum. This really surprised My! As We parked the car in front of the art museum, My explained to her that We had to speak softly, keep We hands off of the exhibits and not run around. Her had never been to a museum before. The building was an old, big, stone building with several steps leading up to the main doors. Her raced up several steps leading up to the main doors and waited at the top for My. When We opened the tall front doors We found out that the rooms were all spacious with high-ceilings. There was a friendly guard there to greet We and a few other people like We who were there just to look around. Each room featured a different type of the art and one room was filled with just one artist's work. My daughter took over 100 pictures of the art We saw the day and included a lot of those pictures in the scrapbook her made of We road trip to Kearney, Nebraska.</text>

    <text>The last time that I cleaned the bathroom, I felt like I really had to work hard to make sure the bathroom was clean because the bathroom had not been cleaned in a while. I was dreading this experience, but knew that this experience had to be done. I got cleaning spray, towels, rags, etc and started to clean. I first cleaned the toilet and made sure the seat and all around the seat was clean. I took the rug out of the bathroom and scrubbed the floor. While doing this, I left the bath water running so that I could use the bath water to clean. After cleaning the floor, I began to clean the tub and I scrubbed until every bit of dirt was cleaned up. I used spray and remained on I hands and knees trying to clean. I also cleaned around the faucet and made sure that the selves were clear and free of dust.</text>

    <text>This morning I decided to make breakfast for I instead of buying breakfast at a cafe. I looked in the fridge and around I kitchen to see what ingredients I had and what I could make with them. I saw that I had eggs, cheese, and an assortment of veggies so I decided to make an omelette. First I cracked three eggs into a bowl and whisked three eggs together, along with some salt and pepper. I then set three eggs aside. I turned on one of the stove burners and let a pan heat up while I chopped up some onion, green and red bell peppers, and spinach. I then poured olive oil into the pan and sauteed my veggies for a few minutes. Once my veggies were cooked, I poured I egg mixture into the pan. Then I grated some cheddar cheese on top and carefully folded an omelette using a spatula. Once an omelette was cooked through, I plated an omelette and ate an omelette for breakfast. An omelette was delicious.</text>

    <text>I woke up very hungry one morning, so I decided I wanted to make an omelette for breakfast. I went down to the kitchen and got out all the supplies I would need. I got out a carton of eggs, the green peppers, red peppers, black olives, and cheddar cheese. I got out a pan and put a pan on the stove. Then I turned on the stove to a medium temperature and cracked three eggs into a pan. I threw the eggshells in the trash and then got out a cutting knife and chopped up the green peppers, red peppers, and black olives. Once three eggs were all chopped I poured three eggs in with the eggs. After a minute or two, I added some cheese to the top. Then I took a spatula and folded one half of an omelette for breakfast on top of the other. Finally, I scooped an omelette for breakfast of a pan and placed a pan on a plate to eat.</text>

    <text>I recently took a taxi when I was staying with a friend in Chicago. The city is very busy, and parking can be hard to find, so The city is often easier to take a taxi to get to place to place. We had decided to go to dinner and see a play. We walked to a street where taxis often go past, and waved to show the driver that We wanted a ride. When We got in a taxi, the driver asked We where We wanted to go. I told the driver the name and address of the Thai restaurant a friend in Chicago and I had planned to go to. He was familiar with the location and We started to travel. On He way, the driver told We that He also enjoyed Thai food and recommended the green curry at the Thai restaurant. As We were driving, I could see how much the cost of the trip would be as the screen along with a small tip displayed a slowly increasing cost. We got to We destination, and I paid the driver the fee on the screen along with a small tip.</text>

    <text>Each morning I got to work across town. I walk three blocks to the underground station. I go down the stairs and then use I card to go through the ticket carousel. Once through, I moved to the side of the platform where I train comes. I stand near the end of the platform and watch the other passengers going about their day. Business people stand looking at Business people phones or staring off into space. School children clump together talking to each other, and parents hold parents children's plans. I glance up at the sign board to see when I train is coming. Five more minutes my train says. I wait, peering down the platform wishing my train to come faster. Then my train rolls into the station and the doors open. One or two people leave the car and I board. I move to the back of the car and take a seat. My train travels down the tracks, stopping every few minutes. After 6 stops, I hear the station name called that I need, get up, grab I bag and exit the car. I walk up the stairs and down the block to I office.</text>

    <text>Last spring, I planted a tree in I backyard. When I was a kid, we always had apples, because we had two apple trees in we backyard. We used to make pies and applesauce and I wanted to have that at I house. I went to the local nursery and I found a 6 foot tree. With delivery, a 6 foot tree was pretty expensive, but I figured a 6 foot tree was worth a 6 foot tree. I dug out an area in I backyard. I was surprised at how long it took and how much dirt that I had to move. Digging the hole took I the longest time of the whole process. I finally got that done and I stuck a 6 foot tree in the ground. I read online about a fertilizer that was good for apple trees and mixed that in with the dirt as I was filling in the area around the roots. I do n't expect to get any apples this year and probably not next year, but a 6 foot tree should be mature enough to start producing apples in the following years. The whole process took I about 3 hours to get a 6 foot tree. I wish I would have paid someone to do a 6 foot tree for I.</text>

It was his first official game and Timothy's was n't about to complain, Timothy's was having too much fun! By the time Timothy's got home, Timothy's was hot, sweaty and very very hungry - So hungry in fact that Timothy's stomach would not stop growling! Timothy's ran to the fridge in a hurry and grabbed the leftover hamburger meat from last night so Timothy's could have a cheese burger. Timothy's was about to put the leftover hamburger meat on a hamburger bun before Timothy's mom stopped Timothy's, saying that the food had to be heated up first so Timothy's did n't get sick from the leftover hamburger meat. Timothy's mom took the food and put the food in a pot on top of his mom gas stove, turned their gas stove on which lit up the flame using gas and heat, and in no time the food was cooked, warm and ready to eat!

    <text>My sons Todd's hair seemed to grow at an exceptionally fast rate compared to other four year olds. Todd's hair seemed as if every single week Todd's needed a hair cut. Todd's would fret every time Todd's knew we were going and even threw tantrums. But once we get there things seemed to be smoother with Todd's. We would grab a seat and wait for our favorite barber to get an opening. As soon as Todd's did Todd's would run up to Todd's and sit in the chair knowing Todd's would get ice cream if Todd's sat still. Our favorite barber draped a piece of plastic around Todd's shoulder so that hair would n't get on Todd's clothes. The sound of the hair clippers tiny motor always had my boy on edge but Todd's always sticks tiny motor out like a champ. Fifteen minutes later a brand new child walks out of the barber shop; clean shaven and ready for a cool yummy treat.</text>

    <text>My classmates and My needed to plant a nice tree in front of the new school building that was just built this year. My wanted to find a tree that would last a quite long time. We found a nice pine tree that was just large enough to be a foot. We dug a nice hole in the ground, and insured the soil was the proper type to accept a tree of this size. The soil had to be nice and soft, and in a safe location where kids wo n't trample over the soil. My dug the hole about 4 '''' deep and insured the soil was wide enough for a nice tree. We planted a nice tree and began to fill in the surrounding area of a nice tree with soil to make sure a nice tree would hold in place as perfect as possible. A nice tree looked perfect and was ready to withstand the first school year outside the new school building that was just built this year.</text>

    <text>Yesterday, I had an appointment to visit the doctor, who was in a room with another patient. Nothing was the matter with I; it was just an annual check-up. I arrived at the doctor, who was in a room with another patient office, checked in, and presented I health insurance card. I had a five dollar co-pay. After I checked in, I sat down in the waiting room, which was empty. Soon, a nurse called my name; my name was time for an appointment to visit the doctor. A nurse weighed I and measured I height. Then, a nurse told I a nurse would take I blood pressure. A nurse put a cuff around I arm and secured a cuff with Velcro. A cuff tightened and then loosened. I blood pressure was normal. After the blood pressure test, a nurse took I pulse. Then, a nurse told I to put on a blue gown and wait for the doctor, who was in a room with another patient. A nurse then left the waiting room, which was empty. Fortunately, I did n't have to wait too long for the doctor, who was in a room with another patient to arrive.</text>

Are there any people walking in the street? Are there any dogs about to run into the road? If so, I need to pay close attention to where they are so I do n't accidentally run into they. I also need to keep I up to date about the weather -- does the weather look like rain? I better be prepared to use I windshield wipers and turn on I headlights. The most important thing I watch out for when I'm driving, though, is other cars. If I know where the other cars are, and can make good guesses about what the drivers of the other cars will do next, I'm in good shape.</text>

    <text>I had been stressed all day. There was so much going on at school and at work. The only thing that ever seems to relax I is a good glass of tea. Fortunately I had several bags at home. I picked out the tea bag and I boiled a pot of the water. I put the tea bag into a mug and waited for the water to come to a boil. After a few minutes, the water was finally hot enough. I took the kettle of water and poured the kettle of water over the teabag for just enough for one cup. I dunked the tea bag a bit, and let the tea bag steep. I waited for the tea to finish steeping and cool off, then I went back and got a mug. A mug tasted wonderful! Best of all, I stress level dropped dramatically. All a mug took was a glass of tea!</text>

    <text>I picked out a nice wallpaper design that I liked in a store. Once I got the wallpaper after you I paid for the wallpaper, I picked a spot on a wall that I wanted to start with. The back of the wallpaper was sticky, so I had to be careful. I held the paper in front of I starting point and made sure that the paper was straight. I started pressing the paper against the wall from the bottom or top first, and slowly pressed towards the other side. I was sure to press everywhere on the paper and got all the bubbles out so the paper stuck well and looked nice. I did the same further down the wall until I covered every part of a wall except the doorway. For the doorway I had to cut out small pieces of the paper to fit around the door, while being very careful that the cuts were straight and looked nice. The room now had new wallpaper and looked very good.</text>

    <text>Several years ago, my family was moving into a house that, based on what we saw, was abandoned. A house that, based on what we saw, was abandoned was left full of belongings with graffiti on the walls, rotten food in a broken refrigerator, spiderwebs in every corner, and so on. After a few months, my parents, along with help from some relatives, began to clean out a house that, based on what we saw, was abandoned. One of the last things that my parents, along with help from some relatives did before we began moving in was take out the carpets in some of the rooms. Instead of carpets, my parents, along with help from some relatives wanted to put the tile in the bedrooms that my parents, along with help from some relatives took the carpets in some of the rooms out of. My parents, along with help from some relatives went to the hardware store and picked out a type of tile that my parents, along with help from some relatives liked the best, and bought enough of tile to cover the entire floors. My parents, along with help from some relatives then proceeded to use cement that my parents, along with help from some relatives bought to lay the tile on the ground one square at a time. My parents, along with help from some relatives did eventually cover the entire floors, and though the tile took some time, the tile looked very nice.</text>

There were a lot of dishes because I had a group of friends over for dinner last night. The first thing I took out of the dishwasher was the drinking glasses. There were five glasses. I put five glasses back in the cupboard. Next, I unloaded the plates. I stacked unloaded the plates on top of each other and put the stack back in the place in the cabinet. After unloading unloaded the plates, I retrieved the bowls from the dishwasher and put unloaded the plates back on unloaded the plates shelves. Lastly, I unloaded the utensils from the dishwasher. The utensils included knives, forks, spoons, and measuring spoons, such as a tablespoon and teaspoon. After I was done putting away the utensils, the job was done. The dishwasher was empty. I felt good about accomplishing this chore.</text>

    <text>Last month I went on a trip to Mexico. I was excited because I had never been to Mexico or flown on a plane before and I was going to get to do both. I booked I flight months in advance to be sure I would have transportation to I vacation destination. The day I was about to leave I went to the airport hours in advance because I was nervous and excited. I checked in at the correct terminal where the flight was supposed to leave from. A nice lady checked I ticket and confirmed that I flight was on schedule. I then proceeded to the security check station where officers checked I bags and personal belongings. After the quick screening and a short wait my plane boarded. I found I seat next to the window and was full of excitement. After some short instructions my plane taxied the runway and then sped up in a flash. I watched as the tires left the ground and we took to the sky. After several hours in the air my plane descended and touched down on a runway in Mexico. I was excited to get I vacation started.</text>

    <text>One day when I was riding I bicycle, and I realized my back tire was getting low. I walked my bicycle back home and pulled out I patch kit. After removing my back tire from my bicycle I let the remaining air out from the valve, and used the small tool on the edge of my back tire, to lift my back tire away and clicked the small tool onto one of the spokes. Using more of the small tools, I continued to lift my back tire away from the rim until I could easily remove the rest of my back tire with I fingers. By this time, the inner tube was exposed, and pushing the valve through, I removed the inner tube completely from my back tire. I put the inner tube into a bucket of water, and used the air pump to pump air back into the inner tube, and watched for bubbles to see where the hole was. I kept a close eye on where the hole was, and taking the inner tube out of a bucket of water, I dried the inner tube with a towel. I used the small sandpaper from my patch kit, and carefully roughed the area around the hole. I then chose a patch. A round one for a puncture, or the rectangle for a slice. I placed glue on a patch, and firmly placed glue on the inner tube. I was very careful, because last time I got glue on I fingers, and I fingers felt funny for days! I went for some lemonade while I waited for a patch to dry. Boy, that lemonade was good on such a hot day. I tried pumping some air back in the inner tube, and carefully watched around a patch, to make sure no air was leaking. I was in luck, a patch was good. I carefully replaced the inner tube into my back tire, and used the small tools to replace my back tire into the rim and used the air pump to fill my back tire back up. Now I was ready for more adventures!</text>

    <text>When I woke up this morning, I decided that the first I was going to do was to take a shower and wash my hair for a few minutes. I did n't want to get I clothes wet, so I undressed and stepped into a shower. I turned the water on and waited to the side until the water warmed up. Then I put my hair for a few minutes underneath the water and started to scrub I head. After my hair for a few minutes was wet, I reached down and grabbed the shampoo that I was currently using. My hair for a few minutes ran out, so I reached for another one. I put the liquid in I hands and started rubbing my hands together. When I hands were foamy, I rubbed my hands through my hair for a few minutes and started to scrub. I let the soap sit in my hair for a few minutes before I dunked I head under the water to make my head all wash off of I.</text>

    <text>I was babysitting for a friend who had a six month old baby girl. I friend had just left to go run some errands when I noticed that a friend who had a six month old baby girl smelled like Savannah's diaper needed to be changed. I pulled out her changing mat, gloves, and some wipes. I unfolded the changing mat on the ground, put on some gloves, and gently placed the baby on the changing mat on the ground, put on some gloves. I unbuttoned the baby's onesie and took off Savannah's diaper. I rolled Savannah's diaper into Savannah's diaper and placed Savannah's diaper in the diaper disposal can right next to I. I used some wipes to clean the baby's onesie off, then took a new diaper out of her diaper container. I opened up a new diaper and lifted up the baby's onesie legs to put a new diaper. I wrapped a new diaper around the front and affixed the adhesive parts of a new diaper to the front. I made sure a new diaper was secure so there would n't be any leaking, and then I rebuttoned the baby's onesie.</text>

    <text>After a long day at work, the thing I want and love the most is a hot bath. I like to run the hot water very hot! I like bubbles added, the kind that smell like mangoes. I pour a glass of wine while the hot water runs, and bring a glass of wine with I into the bathroom. Once the tub is full, I finally allow I to get in. Ah, perfect! I lay back and let the hours of work just slip away. Sometimes I'll bring a book in with I and sink into a good story as the hot water dulls away any aches and pains. I sip on I wine and enjoy the soft popping bubbles around I. When I have finally had enough, I'll slowly drain the tub, and then get up and dry off with a huge fluffy towel. After taking a bath I always feel refreshed and relaxed!</text>

    <text>Today, I made a rather large breakfast consisting of eggs, yogurt, cereal and granola, and assorted fruits, including strawberries, blueberries, oranges, and sliced watermelon bits. I first threw the eggs on the stove pan and supplemented the edibles with salt and pepper - an American tradition. Next, I starting slicing and dicing the various food types I bought at the grocery store yesterday night. Unfortunately, I had no meat on hand, but I suppose this is beneficial and less damaging to the environment. The cereal and granola were easy, and were eventually mixed and added to a bowl of lush, thick, 2% milk. Next comes the absolute best part: I proceeded to devour the bulk of the preparation in one fell swoop. The food was short lived, but oh so satisfying. I have been watching I calories recently, so this meal was the perfect way to stay a beautiful, fit day.</text>

    <text>I love Macaroni and cheese, actually shells and cheese are I favorite. I could eat Macaroni every day. I decided it was time to learn how to make Macaroni for I, so I watched I mom as I was making dinner one night. I put a pot of the boiling water on to boil as I stood behind I watching I every more. I shook the box of the cooked pasta, and the hard shells rattled against the box of pasta. When the boiling water started boiling mom added the cooked pasta to the water and stirred the cooked pasta with a spoon. I set a timer on the stove for eight minutes to remind I to check on the cooked pasta. The cooked pasta was a long eight minutes when you are hungry. I pulled a colander out of the cabinet and placed the cabinet in the sink. Finally a timer dinged, and I removed the boiling water and the cooked pasta from the stove for eight minutes and poured the boiling water into a colander out. The boiling water went through the tiny holes and left the cooked pasta in the bowl. I added the steamy noodles back to the pot and added cheese. Finally, Macaroni!</text>

    <text>Greg was sitting in Greg house one summer day and saw that Greg lawn needed to be mowed. Greg went to Greg backyard and opened the shed he saw his mower, in the shed Greg saw the mower out. Greg then pushed the mower out of the shed he saw his mower and tried to turn the shed he saw his mower on. The mower out would n't start, the mower out was out of gas. Greg looked in Greg shed for some gas and lucky for Greg, Greg found some. Greg took some gas can and filled the mower out up with gasoline. Greg then started up the mower out and started cutting the grass, after that Greg turned off the mower out and pushed the mower out back into the backyard. Greg pushed the mower out into the shed he saw his mower and felt very accomplished Greg went inside and Greg worked so hard that Greg got a snack from the fridge and then Greg took a shower and then went to sleep.</text>

    <text>I made plans to cook a special meal for I on I birthday. Pondering on what I would like to have for I special meal, I flipped through a few cookbooks and landed on shrimp alfredo. I can recall this recipe being phenomenal. I favorite pasta is angel hair pasta, which I already had in I pantry, and all the other ingredients were in the refrigerator. I begin preparing I meal by putting a large pot of the water to boil, adding a pinch of salt, and a drizzle of olive oil. Once the water began to boil rapidly I dropped I pasta in and stirred, then I let My favorite pasta boil for about seven minutes. I prepared I sauce as My favorite pasta. To check the pasta I tasted one string of my sauce, perfect, My favorite pasta was drained. I plated I special meal, My favorite pasta then my sauce and a sprinkle of parsley. Delicious!!!</text>

    <text>With a bright flash, the light was no more and the light was suddenly dark. The light bulb in our kitchen had burned out. Since I wanted to be able to see clearly in our kitchen, I made a short walk to our supply closet hoping that a spare light bulb would be there. Fortunately, our had one spare light bulb available, so I took one spare light bulb out of the package and headed to the kitchen. I could not reach one spare light bulb without help, so I had to use a footstool to reach the light bulb located up near the ceiling. I carefully stepped up on a footstool to reach the light bulb located up near the ceiling and removed one spare light bulb and threw one spare light bulb away in the trash can. Then I installed one spare light bulb and the light immediately returned. Now I was able to see our kitchen clearly again. However, I'll need to go to the store soon since I'm now out of light bulbs.</text>

    <text>I was almost out of gas in my car yesterday. The red low fuel light came on. I new I only had about one gallon of the gas left in the gas tank. So I could only drive about 30 miles. I was on I way home and not in a hurry. I found a gas station and pulled in. I forgot what side the opening was to put the gas into my car so had to drive to a different pump on the same side of my car to put the gas in. I do not like how gas smells so I go to the other side of my car while my car is filling up. I found some trash in my car and gathered some trash all up and threw some trash away. The gas tank was filled up and I turned off the gas pump. I am glad to be done with this.</text>

Once the shower got hot I got into the shower. I got I hair wet and put some hair conditioner into I hand. I put some hair conditioner into I hair.

    <text>This morning, I noticed our family cat's food and water dishes were empty. Our family cat's food and water dishes was time to feed the cat's! On the floor of our kitchen pantry there is a supply of cat food in several varieties. We like to feed We cat both ``wet ''and`` dry'' cat food. Wet cat food is usually moist and comes in cans. Dry cat food generally comes in bags or boxes, much like the breakfast cereals people eat come in bags or boxes. And, of course, Dry cat food is dry. Although We have wet cat food flavors ranging from seafood to pork, the cat's enjoys chicken the most, so I opened a can of chicken-flavored cat food and placed its contents in the cat's food bowl. Next I scooped a good-size portion of dry cat food and placed a good-size portion of dry cat food in the cat's food bowl. Finally, I put fresh water in a separate bowl. Once finished, the cat's enthusiastically approached the cat's food bowl and began eating. Her purred as her ate.</text>

    <text>It was time to do the dishes. I picked up the dishes from the table and everywhere else around the house. I put the dishes in the sink in the kitchen. I found the dishwashing liquid under the sink. I poured a bit of the dishwashing liquid into the sink as I was running the hot water. I used hot water, as I find that the hot water works best for getting I dishes clean. I did other little tasks around the house as I let the dishes soak in the hot water. When the dishes had sat for a good while, I decided to start scrubbing the dishes. I grabbed a rag and started washing the dishes inside and out. I ran some water in the other basin so that I could rinse the soap off. After I rinsed the dishes, I set the dishes in a dish drainer. I let the dishes dry off before saving the dishes.</text>

    <text>One of my favorite daily rituals involves making the coffee. My do it every single day at least once, and sometime twice. My am not sure if it is the flavor of the coffee or the smell and sound of the coffee that my enjoy the most. The first thing my do when my wake up is change my clothes and brush my teeth. The very next thing my do is head to the kitchen to make coffee. My first choose my cup for the day. My favorite is an insulated stainless steel lidded cup that keeps the coffee burning hot. Next, my fill my cup with water and pour my cup into the coffee maker. My then add coffee grinds to the coffee maker single serving basket. My also push the grinds down with a small juice cup, in hopes that a small juice cup makes a small juice cup stronger. My press start and the drip begins! 5 minutes later, my have a cup of coffee in my cup. My add some flavored creamer, place my lid on and my am set for the day.</text>

    <text>The family and I decided it was time to paint a wall in the hallway a new color. We talked about it and everyone suggested everyone favorite color. After a short conversation We decided on turquoise. Everyone got into the car to go to Lowe's to pick up some paint and supplies. We went to the display with the colored squares and found the one that was closest to the color We had picked and handed that square to the person working so she could mix square to the person working so she for We. When We had the paint the paint was time to get other supplies. We bought a paint roller with a tray and two paint brushes and some tape to keep everything neat. We got in the car and went back home. We used the tape to separate the area to be painted so that their favorite color would not get anywhere We did not want their favorite color. We set up the tray and paint roller then passed out brushes. Everyone took turns painting a wall. We rested when We were finished to give the paint time to dry.</text>

    <text>Every week I make a shopping list with the intentions of sticking to a shopping list and not buying extra things but more importantly, remembering all the things I really need to get. I put a date on the top so I know a date is this weeks list and list everything I need to get for that week. Sometimes l list the store next to the item if I need to make a special trip to a special kind of store. For groceries, a shopping list is just random. I like to group groceries if groceries are related or located in a nearby section in the grocery store but a shopping list's generally random as I think about each item. I may draw boxes or line to separate the categories or stores. Generally, I use a weird color ink so I easily recognize that a weird color ink is I list and a weird color ink makes shopping errands happen more quickly and efficiently.</text>

    <text>Last week we planned for a picnic in we family. As part of a picnic, we wanted some drink to get prepared. Instead of buying our first fresh orange juice, we planned to prepare fresh orange juice. I and my brother Kevin took the responsibility to prepare our first fresh orange juice. We parents shopped good, fresh oranges. I and my brother Kevin peeled good, fresh oranges well. Once we done peeling good, fresh oranges, we blend good, fresh oranges all using a blender. Then we filtered our first fresh orange juice with a filter to get pure juice. My brother Kevin tasted our first fresh orange juice and complained that our first fresh orange juice was very tangy. So we added some water and sugar to our first fresh orange juice to get the taste of the juice. If we add more water, the taste of our first fresh orange juice will get spoiled. So we added water little by little. Finally we got good taste. We asked we mom to taste our first fresh orange juice and finalize our first fresh orange juice. Our mom to taste the juice and finalize it also liked our first fresh orange juice and we were very happy on the preparation of we first fresh orange juice.</text>

    <text>The doorbell rang. I was not expecting anyone to visit today. It was unusual for The doorbell to ring in the morning because most of I friends and family were at work. Maybe It was one of I neighbors needing something. Maybe It was someone selling something. I got up from I place at the table where I was working on I book. I am a writer and I work from home. I was cautious as I approached the door. I pulled back the curtains slightly on the window next to the door and looked out. I wanted to see who was ringing the bell before I opened the door. The door pays to be cautious these days. If the door is someone I do n't know, a stranger, I will answer the door with the chain still hooked and ask what they need. The chain was the mailman, bringing I a package. I answered the door and signed for a package.</text>

    <text>This morning, I made breakfast for I and I family. I made scrambled eggs, crispy bacon, and toast. We had two types of bread in the house - whole wheat and cinnamon raisin. I chose to toast the cinnamon raisin bread, because I thought the sweetness would be a nice compliment to the saltiness of crispy bacon and eggs. I placed two slices of the cinnamon raisin bread at a time. I did this three times, for a total of six slices of bread. We all like We bread only slightly toasted, so this did not take a long time. Once they were all toasted, I spread a thin layer of butter onto each slice of toast. Then I placed two slices of toast on each plate, along with three strips of bacon and a pile of scrambled eggs. I poured everyone a glass of orange juice and then we sat down to eat breakfast together. It tasted delicious.</text>

After We took the tilapia home, We began We preparation. We retrieved a pan from the cabinet, put some oil in the cabinet, and squeezed one whole lemon in some oil. We turned the heat to medium high. My was so excited because My daughter was able to help My with all of these steps as my daughter just turned 9 last week. We laughed and danced while some oil was heating up. We then proceeded to put the fish in the oil. We added a small amount of garlic and pepper to the top and let a small amount of garlic and pepper simmer for a few minutes. While a small amount of garlic and pepper was simmering My daughter told My about my daughter day at school. My daughter had a busy day so it was nice to hear all about it. We flipped the fish in the oil over and let the fish in the oil cook for another 3-4 minutes and then the fish in the oil was done. We ate that tilapia with mashed potatoes and a salad. The fish in the oil was delicious.</text>

    <text>Last night I made hamburgers and fries for dinner. First, I got out a frying pan and placed a frying pan on the burner. I also preheated the oven. I pulled out burger patties from the fridge and placed burger patties in the hot skillet. While burger patties were frying, I got frozen French fries out of the freezer, put burger patties on a baking sheet, and put burger patties in the oven once the freezer had preheated. I set the timer for 16 minutes, which was the recommended on the fry bag. I also got out the hamburger buns, ketchup, mustard, onion, cheese, pickles, and lettuce for people to put on people burgers. By this time, their burgers were ready to be flipped, which I did using a metal spatula. The timer for 16 minutes, which was the recommended on the fry bag went off for frozen French fries, so I took frozen French fries out of the oven carefully with oven mitts on and set frozen French fries out to cool. I got out plates and napkins and set the table. Once their burgers were ready, we served we and made up we burgers.</text>

    <text>Recently when my family visited the local food bank, my family gave us a lot of all these oranges. Not knowing what to really do with all these oranges, my came up with the idea of making fresh juice out of my family. In order to do this, my knew that us needed to peel all these oranges, and us needed to but my family inside of a blender or food processor. Us had all of this, so us figured it would be easy. One by one, my peeled all of all these oranges. My mom cut my family open to take out as much of the seeds as possible. Once us were sure that My mom got out enough of the seeds, us put all these oranges in the blender and blended the blender into the best juice we ever had. Us each had a glass of the juice right then and there and stored the rest in a pitcher in the refrigerator. Us all agreed it was some of the best juice we ever had.</text>

    <text>I need to go grocery shopping this weekend so I am in the process of making a shopping list. I'll look through I fridge, freezer and cabinets to see what I am low on and need to restock that I use regularly; coffee, stevia, mint tea bags, paper towels. I'll also check to see if I need anything like shampoo or deodorant. When I get the grocery store ads and coupons in the mail I will look through to see what is on sale or what I have a coupon for and I will plan I meals based on what I can get at a good price. Once I have figured out meals I'll check to see if there are ingredients that I already have. I will then make I list organized according to what I can get at what store. I do the majority of I shopping at one store so that will be the big chunk of a shopping list but there are some things that I have to go to other stores for, I will put that on the other side of the paper. Once I have a shopping list, I'll double check a shopping list and head out to go shopping.</text>

    <text>The front lawn was getting shaggy, so I decided to mow the grass. I put on I sunscreen and changed into I mowing shoes, and then went to the garage to get the mower. I first checked to see if the mower needed gas, and then added some from the gas can I keep in the garage. Now that I was ready to mow, I put on I work gloves, and rolled the mower outside. Then I opened the gas flow on the engine and then shifted the gas flow lever to the bunny rabbit setting, for full. Then I pulled the cord fast, and the mower started up. I moved the gas flow lever down to the work setting and shifted the gas flow lever to on, and started mowing. I started right in front of the house, making a big circle to border by the street. I was sure to mow so I was facing oncoming traffic, because I house does n't have a sidewalk. I kept mowing in a big circle until I got into the middle, where the bird bath is. I moved the cord aside, mowed that patch, and then the front lawn was done. I took the mower back into the garage, closed the gas flow lever, and then went inside and had a lemonade.</text>

    <text>When I went on vacation last year with I parents, we took a trip on the right train for part of a trip. We picked the route we wanted to take to go visit I uncle, and had everything ready the day before, such as we suitcases. When the day arrived for we to go, I dad drove we to the train station where we parked in a designated lot, since we would be returning to the same train station. We then headed to the train station and went inside where I dad purchased our tickets. We had some extra time, so we wandered around and found a little gift shop where we could buy souvenirs. When a little gift shop was time to board we train, we walked through the station to get to the correct area. There were long hallways to get there, and then we went up a concrete pathway to where the right train was outside. We had to give the ticket taker our tickets so she could verify we were getting on the right train. We all gathered in the right train and found some seats that had n't been taken. We stored our luggage and prepared for the right train to begin the right train journey. Once our luggage was time to leave, we watched out the windows at all the passing scenery. After awhile, we all started doing our own thing like reading or playing cards to pass the time. Our own thing was a lot of fun and really neat to take the right train trip.</text>

    <text>When I woke up this morning I wanted to drink coffee. I got out of bed and went to the kitchen. I took the coffee pot off of the base and brought the coffee pot to the sink. I rinsed the coffee pot well, then refilled the coffee pot water. I filled the coffee pot with enough water to make six cups, to the line that said six. I lifted the back of the coffee maker, where the water goes, and poured the water from the pit into it. Once I did that I placed the coffee pot the coffee pot back on the base. I went to the cupboard and got out the can of coffee grounds. I grabbed a coffee filter as well. I put a coffee filter into the coffee filter crate. I then carefully, using a spoon, measure three table spoons of coffee grounds from the can, putting them into a coffee filter. I closed the coffee filter crate and plugged the coffee maker, where the water goes, and poured the water from the pit into it in. I pressed the on button and waited for I delicious coffee to drip down in to the pot.</text>

    <text>When I woke up today, I went to the fish tank to make sure I fish were happy and healthy. They needed to be fed, so opened the lid of the tank. I picked up the bottle of fish food and took off the cap. I reached in and pinched some of the flakes between my fingers and dropped some of the flakes between my fingers in the tank. Some of the flakes between my fingers floated on the water as I fish swam over and started to eat. I put in a few more pinches of fish food; there was one small pinch of food for each fish in the tank, so I could be sure they all had enough to eat, grow, and be healthy. I went to work for the day and when I came home, I made sure to clean any remaining food from the morning before feeding some of the flakes between my fingers again -- I knew I fish needed dinner as well as breakfast!</text>

    <text>When the trains are running late, the underground gets crowded. When Bob went to catch a subway train after work, Bob could n't see at first that the trains were running late. There had been no line at the turnstile when Bob put in Bob ticket to open the fare gate. The escalator had been a little bit crowded, but The escalator always was at this time of day, when so many got off work. However, when Bob got down to the platform Bob saw there was a huge crowd waiting for a train. Bob heard someone in a huge crowd waiting for a train say that there was a train stalled at the last station. However, the next thing Bob heard was the tooting of a train approaching the platform. Soon Bob was able to take Bob place in the car. Bob had to stand up all the way to Bob station, but as all the way turned out, Bob got home on time.</text>

    <text>The other week, I was n't feeling very good and did n't want to eat. Instead of getting something heavy, I opted for my soup. I also did n't want to have to go out anywhere to get my soup so I made my soup I. I put the broth into a large bowl and boiled the broth. Then I put salt and pepper in the broth and found some precooked chicken and put some precooked chicken in too. I let it all sit in the stove for a long time while some precooked chicken boiled. Maybe 10 or 15 minutes. Upon some precooked chicken starting to boil, I turned the stove off and let my soup sit there for a while. I started to get hungry and put my soup into a bowl. I then put crackers in a bowl after crushing crackers into small pieces. A bowl tasted very good and seemed like the perfect way to make chicken soup. This was the best way to make This.</text>

My looked up the schedule to see what time we would need to be there for the underground to the city. The schedule to see what time we would need to be there for the underground to the city also listed prices for the underground. We made sure to have enough money to pay for the underground before we got there. Once there, we waited patiently for a few minutes. We wanted to get there a little bit early just in case there were any mishaps on the way there. Once the underground pulled up, we paid we fees and found a seat to sit on for the trip. When we got to we stop there was a crowd of people waiting to get on the underground. We made sure to stay together and got off at the same time so we would not get lost in the crowds.</text>

A blanket to sit on was blue and sturdy. We drove out to the lake and wandered around for a while for the perfect picnic spot. I wanted to sit close to the lake and still have shade.

    <text>We had just bought the new house, but there were a few final upgrades needed until the day We could finally come in. After much deliberation We decided to rip out the worn, cracked tiles in the kitchen and put in a new tile floor. We measured everything one last time. Then, starting at the far end of the kitchen I knelt down and began spreading the pasty grout across a new tile floor. I took one tile and placed one tile in the corner, pressing on one tile to set one tile in well. Then I picked up one tile and set one tile next to the first. I continued to move across the back wall of the kitchen in this manner, occasionally scrapping any extra grout back into the bucket. When the first row was in place, I backed up and spread more grout so I could start laying another row of tiles. I repeated one tile until a new tile floor was done and I was exhausted.</text>

    <text>Last night, I decided to take a bath. First, I turned on the soapy water. I fiddled with the knobs to get the right mix of hot and cold water. Once the temperature was pleasing to I, I put the stopper in the tub for a while and let the tub fill with water. I also poured some bubble bath into the water stream so that bubbles filled the tub for a while. Once the tub for a while was filled with water and bubbles, I took off I clothes and sat down in the tub for a while. I submerged I body in the soapy water. I used a loofah to wash I. I then sat back and relaxed in the tub for a while. I had put the book that I was reading on the side of the tub for a while and I decided to read the tub for a while. The tub for a while was very relaxing. When I was done in the tub for a while, I pulled the stopper out and let the soapy water drain away. I had a very nice bath.</text>

    <text>Sometimes I really hate visiting the doctor's. But at the same time I feel good because if anything is wrong with I the doctor's will be able to help. When I think I'm either sick or just to make sure I'm healthy I make the first available appointment. I call the doctor's office and make the first available appointment. When the doctor's office's 20 minutes before the doctor's office's time for I appointment, I leave I house to go. Once I get to the doctor office I find a place to park. I walk inside the doctor's office and check in with the receptionist. I got wait in the waiting room for I name to be called. Once they call I name I go straight to the scale to get weighed, I always hate this part. Then the nurse takes I to the room, takes I blood pressure and asks why I'm there. I'm only there to check I cholesterol since last time I had my cholesterol checked my cholesterol was high. The doctor's then comes in to talk about I last results and says that we will check my cholesterol again today and then call the doctor's back in 3 months if my cholesterol's high to talk about I options. I then go get I blood drawn in the lab. After that is done I go to the check out window and pay I copay for I visit.</text>

    <text>Every week I like to wash I bedding. As soon as I get out of bed in the morning, I take all of the blankets and pillows off the whole bed. I put all of the blankets and pillows on the floor, as I will eventually clean all of the blankets and pillows in the washing machine. I then remove the sheets from the whole bed, first the top sheet and then the fitted sheet. I have to walk around the whole bed to get sheet off because I bed is very large. I carry the sheets to the washing machine and clean the sheets. I dry the sheets in the dryer after the sheets are clean. I take the sheets out of the dryer when the sheets are clean and warm. I then put the sheets back on the bed, 1st the fitted sheet and then the top sheet. The fitted sheet takes more time because I have to put sheet on the correct way. Sometimes I get sheet wrong and have to turn sheet around and try again. After putting then the top sheet on, I pick up the rest of the blankets and wash/dry the sheets also.</text>

    <text>When I woke up this morning the first thing I saw was how many all my dirty clothes in the bag were lying all over the floor of my room. I told I in I head that I needed to wash all my dirty clothes in the bag as soon as possible because my room looked like a tornado came through my room. I gathered all my dirty clothes in the bag around my room and I bathroom into I dirty clothes hamper laundry bag. I use laundry bag because I live upstairs and I do n't like having to back track across I home if I drop any clothes when I bring any clothes to the washing machine which is located downstairs. I know had all I dirty clothes in laundry bag and walked downstairs to begin washing any clothes. I start by throwing all my dirty clothes in the bag into the washing machine followed by using whatever laundry detergent I have at the time. Today I still had some liquid detergent left over from the last load of laundry I did so I carefully measured half a cup of detergent into half a cup of detergent and dumped half a cup of detergent over all my dirty clothes in the bag. I closed the washing machine followed by using whatever laundry detergent I have at the time and turned the dial on the machine to run for 45 minutes.</text>

    <text>I had been playing with I new lego set and puzzle all day. I mother came in my room and told I my room looked like a pig lived there and that I needed to clean all I toys up immediately. I did not want to but knew I should obey I mother's wishes. I got the box for the completed puzzle piece and opened the box up. I began to break apart the completed puzzle piece by piece. I put the lego pieces back into the box. I then found a spot for the completed puzzle piece on I closet shelf. Next I needed to clean up the legos. Some were constructed into a castle I built.The rest of the lego pieces were scattered everywhere around my room. I got the container they came in and started putting the lego pieces into my room. My room was not as much fun as building with they. Once I had found every one I closed the lid and put the lid away. I looked around and was pleased to see a clean room and I mother smiling.</text>

    <text>Last week one of the light bulbs in my living room burned out. Unfortunately my living room was not a bulb in a lamp, but instead my living room was in the ceiling. The problem was that the ceiling in my living room is very tall and the ceiling in my living room ca n't be reached without a ladder. The first thing my had to do was to go to the hardware store to buy a replacement bulb. My did n't have any extra ones in my house. When my got back from the store my took the tallest ladder my have out of my garage and brought my garage into my living room. My then got an extension tool that my can use to make my reach longer and my got onto a ladder and stretched up as high as my could with the extension tool to unscrew the burned out bulb. Then my put a replacement bulb on the end of an extension tool and reached up to screw an extension tool back in. After that my flipped the light switch to make sure the light switch worked and the light switch did!</text>

    <text>I was hungry and did n't feel like cooking so I decided to order a pizza. I looked up the phone number to I favorite local pizza place and gave them a call. As a call was a busy night a call took a minute for them to answer the phone. When the employee answered the employee asked what I would like. I first asked to hear the specials, I like to save a buck when I can. The employee told I some various specials and so I decided to go with one of those. I ordered a pizza with pepperoni, a bottle of cola, and some garlic bread sticks. The employee told I I total and I paid over the phone using I credit card. The employee told I it would be about forty-five minutes before my food to arrive arrived. I thanked the employee and waited for my food to arrive. About thirty minutes later there was a knock at I door and a was the delivery guy. The employee was very polite and I tipped the employee nicely. I really enjoyed my food to arrive.</text>

    <text>I realized yesterday that I was running out of clean clothes to wear. I gathered up all of my dirty clothes and sorted all of my dirty clothes into light and dark colors. I put all of my dirty clothes into the baskets and took all of my dirty clothes to I laundry room. I put two detergent pods in I washing machine and then put in clean clothes from one of the baskets. I made sure the wash settings were how I wanted all of my dirty clothes and then closed my washing machine and started my washing machine. Once the wash cycle had ended, I took clean clothes out of my washing machine and put all of my dirty clothes in the dryer. I added a dryer sheet and adjusted the wash settings, and then I closed the dryer and started the dryer. When clean clothes had finished drying, I took all of my dirty clothes out and folded all of my dirty clothes neatly and put all of my dirty clothes away in I room. Then, I did the same thing with the next load of laundry.</text>

    <text>When I do n't pick up after I, I flat can become very messy and dirty. I do n't like a messy, dirty flat so I make sure that I clean up every weekend. On Saturday morning, I wake up early and get ready to clean. First, I pick up all of the toys and all the things that are not in the place where they belong. I put the toys in the toy box. I put the dirty clothes in the laundry room hamper. I throw away any garbage I find. When everything is put away, I use a duster to get the dust off all of the furniture. I make sure to wipe down all the surfaces so all the surfaces are dust-free and clean. Next, I use a broom and sweep the floors. When I'm done sweeping the floors, I fill up a bucket with soap and water. I use a mop to wash the floors.</text>

    <text>When I last changed a baby diaper, a baby diaper was for I little cousin. I first undressed her and took off a baby diaper and put a baby diaper aside. I then used a wet nap to wipe her body and make sure that her was clean. After that, I put a little baby powder on her and put started to put a new diaper on here. During the whole process, her was having difficulty sitting still, shaking and moving her legs the entire time. The whole process was somewhat difficult because her would not sit still. Upon putting a baby diaper on, I then put her shirt on and let her lay there for a minute while I threw everything out. Her seemed content and happy and her was definitely clean. This was not very easy to do, but ultimately I was able to change her. The smell was definitely better after the fact!</text>

    <text>I like taking a bath instead of a shower sometimes. I start by closing the drain at the bottom of the tub. Some tubs have a stopper and some have a thing you push down to close a stopper. After a stopper's closed I like to run both hot and cold water to make warm water and then I let the tub fill up to about a hand's height from the top of the tub. While warm water is running, I squirt in bubbles and make sure I have a clean washcloth and towel. After I carefully climb into the tub, I make sure I wash I whole body with the soap and washcloth, even behind I ears and between I toes. Then I can either soak and relax in the tub or I can play with toys. Fun toys for the bathtub are boats and plastic water animals like whales and ducks. Once warm water starts to turn a little cold, warm water's time to get out so I open the drain again and let warm water empty out. While warm water's draining I carefully stand up and reach for I towel to dry off. I always be sure the tub is clean when I'm finished, with toys and the dirty washcloth put where the dirty washcloth belong.</text>

    <text>I prepared the purple colored paint that I was using to paint the large wall in I bedroom by prying open the paint can's lid and stirring the purple colored paint with a wooden stick. Upon opening the can, I immediately smelled the strong paint scent. I poured a large amount of paint into a rolling pan and rolled I paint roller through a rolling pan. I scraped the purple colored paint off on the side of a rolling pan and began to paint the large wall in my bedroom. I started from the top and moved to the bottom, rolling my paint roller in more paint as my paint roller was needed. I trimmed the edges of the large wall in my bedroom with a small paint brush. When a rolling pan ran low on paint, I poured more into a rolling pan can. I waited for the large wall in my bedroom to dry, then applied a second layer of purple paint. I touched up areas before cleaning up the purple colored paint and washing out I brushes.</text>

    <text>Today I folded clothes. First, I went to the laundry room and picked up my laundry basket which was full of clean clothes. Next I put my laundry basket which was full on my table. I picked the next piece of clothing out of the basket. The next piece of clothing was a T-shirt. I held a T-shirt up against I body so a T-shirt hung down without any wrinkles. Then I folded a T-shirt in half horizontally. Holding a T-shirt by a T-shirt folded seam, I folded a T-shirt again, this time vertically. A T-shirt was now folded. It is flat and does not have any wrinkles or bulges. I place a T-shirt on my table neatly. I pick the next piece of clothing out of the basket. The next piece of clothing is shorts. I hold these by the waistband and fold only once, vertically. I put these on top of a T-shirt on my table. This is my pile of folded clothes. I pick up the next piece of clothing. This is a pair of jeans. I hold these by the waistband and shake gently to release any wrinkles. I fold once vertically -LRB- vertically is the way the zipper of the jeans runs-up and down -RRB-.

    <text>I was gathering my laundry and decided to wash I sheets and the comforter. I pulled the comforter off and laid the comforter on the floor, then I took off the sheet, fitted sheet and pillow cases. I put the sheets &amp; pillow cases in the basket and put the comforter on top of the basket. After washing and drying all of my laundry, I put the fitted the sheet on my clean, well made bed. I found the bottom of the sheet and put the bottom of the sheet between the mattress and box spring on my clean, well made bed, trying to center the bottom of the sheet between the mattress and box spring the best I could. I tucked the bottom of the sheet between the mattress and box spring. I put the pillows in the pillowcases and put two pillows on each side of my clean, well made bed, at the top. I pulled up the sheet so the sheet partially covered the pillows. I then put the comforter on my clean, well made bed and centered the comforter the best I could. I smoothed the comforter out and stood back to admire I clean, well made bed.</text>

    <text>One day, I went into I kitchen and I noticed that I garbage can was full. My garbage was starting to come out of the opening of my garbage can, and my garbage smelled bad. I knew I had to change my garbage bag. I took the lid off of my garbage can, and took my garbage bag out. I tied my garbage bag up in a knot, making sure to tie my garbage bag tight so no garbage could fall out. I went out the door to I yard, where I big garbage bins are. I put my garbage bag in the bin, so the garbage truck can take my garbage bag away when the garbage truck comes around. Then, I went back inside and got a new bag out of I cabinet. I placed a new bag in my garbage can, making sure to fold the opening of my garbage bag securely around the lip of the can. Once I did that, I put the lid off of my garbage back on.

    <text>I decided that I wanted to go to a shopping center, so I grabbed my purse to get ready to go. But first, I made sure that I had the wallet back in my purse, and that inside there was I credit card and I driver's license, as well as some cash. I put the wallet back in my purse, grabbed I cell phone and the keys of the admission to the car and I headed out the door. After locking the house, I got into my car, started the ignition and took off, headed to the center. As I drove down the street, I had to follow traffic signals such as stop signs and stop lights as I made I way through the city into the location where the shopping center was. When I arrived in the parking lots of the shopping center, I identified the stores that I regretted to shot back. Once I saw that they were all mostly located in the West Wing of the shopping center, I began looking for a parking space that side of the shopping center. Once I drove around and spotted a parking spot, I navigated my car into a parking space that side of the shopping center, making sure that I am not too close to either of the cars on both sides of I, then cut my car off. I checked my purse to get ready to go more time to make sure that I had everything I needed, took the keys of the admission, grabbed my purse to get ready to go and got out of my car. I shut the door, and locked the doors to secure I vehicle, then headed into the first store that I was going to begin I shopping at.</text>

    <text>Yesterday I found a great recipe for a chocolate cake with peanut butter swirls. I went to the store to buy all the ingredients. I had to get eggs, sugar, milk and peanut butter. I got out a big mixing bowl and mixed all the ingredients up with a big wooden spoon. I preheated the oven while I was mixing everything together. I had to wait a few minutes for the oven to be ready for the concoction sitting on I counter. I poured the batter into a cake pan and licked a big wooden spoon. I put a cake pan into the oven and waited 25 minutes. A cake pan smelled incredible while a cake pan was baking. I tested the moisture of a chocolate cake by sticking a toothpick into the middle. A cake pan was perfect. I let the cake cool for 30 minutes and then cut the cake cool for 30 minutes into pieces. I shared the cake cool for 30 minutes with I family and we all agreed the cake cool for 30 minutes was one of the tastiest cakes we've ever eaten.</text>

    <text>When I woke up, I was very hungry. I wanted to eat an omelette. To make an omelette I had to make sure I had all the ingredients ready. I got some milk from the fridge. Then some cheese and butter, and last the eggs. I was only making some milk for I, so I only needed two eggs. I got a bowl out from the cupboard, as well as a whisk. I cracked the eggs over a bowl, making sure not to get any pieces of shell in a bowl, then threw the egg shells away. I used the whisk to break the yokes, then mix the egg shells well. I poured a little bit of milk in the bowl with the eggs, and whisked a little bit of milk even more. Once a little bit of milk was all mixed well, I got a pan out. I cut a little bit of the hot butter and put in on a pan. I places a pan on the stove and heated a pan until a pan melted the hot butter. When a pan was warm enough, I poured the egg and milk mixture into the hot butter. I let a pan cook for a while, then used a spatula to flip it.When a pan was almost done I added some cheese on the top. A spatula to flip it.When it was almost done I added some cheese on the top was very tasty.</text>

    <text>The last time I went to a wedding was many years ago. The last time I went to a wedding was for an older cousin of I who was getting married to her boyfriend of a few years. I needed to dress very nice for the wedding ceremony. Since I was a kid at the time, I parents picked out my outfit. My parents ironed my outfit so that my outfit looked as clean as possible. My parents also dressed I younger brother and my parents very nicely. We showed up to the wedding right on schedule. It was being held in a local wedding hall, so the atmosphere was very calm and quiet. We were around several other family members who were also there in support. We all watched as the wedding ceremony took place. We listened to the vows getting exchanged, watched the rings get exchanged, listened to the priest's sermon, and watched the two newlyweds kiss each other. The two newlyweds kiss was a very beautiful moment.</text>

I called He over to the door and got He leash off the hook on the wall. I clipped Oscar's leash to He collar and we went out. There is a wooded walking trail by I house so I decided that's where we should walk today. Oscar's pulled on Oscar's leash when we got in the woods because he wanted to smell so many things. We walked along the path for quite a while until we got to the lake. I sat on the bench by the lake and Oscar's sat with I, looking at the ducks on the water. After a little while we got up and walked back home. When we got home, I took off Oscar's leash and he went to rest in the living room.</text>

    <text>I decided I was going to cook the pasta for dinner. However, I first needed to decide what kind of the pasta since there are many types. I looked in I pantry and saw spaghetti, ravioli, tortellini and angel hair. I decided I'd cook a pot of spaghetti. I took the box out and set the box out on the counter. I then pulled a large deep pot out of the cupboard. I filled a large deep pot with the water. I then put a large deep pot on a burner on the stove. I poured into a large deep pot a little olive oil and shook a little salt in the water. This is too ensure the pasta does not stick together while the pasta is cooking. I then put the lid on a large deep pot and turned on a burner to high. I needed to wait about 10 minutes for the water to start boiling. When it was boiling, I took off the lid and set the lid onto the counter. I picked up the box of pasta, opened the lid and took half of the lid out. The lid is long strands of dry pasta. I held a large deep pot all in one hand around the middle. I then held the bottom ends above the water and slowly lowered the whole batch into the water spreading the whole batch around in a circle. As the pasta became moister the pasta lowered into the water until all of the pasta was submerged. I lowered the heat so that the heat was at a low boil or simmer. I then set the timer for 10 minutes. When the timer dinged, I pulled out one and tested the timer to see if the timer was done. The timer was perfectly al dente. I took a large deep pot off the stove and poured out the contents into a strainer. A large deep pot was finished.</text>

    <text>I don; t go to the mall often, but when I do t's an all day outing. I girl and I shower and get dressed in our favorite trendy clothes, wear our favorite scents and she takes 30 minutes doing she makeup. Making sure we each have we phones, keys, and payment cards, we lock the door and head to the car. The door takes about 30 minutes to get to the nearest shopping center. We prefer to park near the back because the back's closer to a door and the stores we prefer within the shopping center. As always we beeline for we favorite stores first, then we second favorites taking about thirty minutes in each store. We go back and forth looking for the best deals too. We really enjoy helping each other pick out clothes that look good on we. Once we are done shopping we usually discuss which restaurant we would like to go to. It's usually The Chinese buffet and sushi bar across the street or the Arby's a little further away... we fins out that the Arby's has closed. We decided to go back to the shopping center and check out the food court, because several new joints have been put in since the last time we visited.</text>

    <text>It's time to clean the bathroom again. First I need to gather all of the things I need. I will need a sponge and a mop and bucket to clean the floor, a brush and some cleaning chemicals. I'll start with the shower. I'll put some cleaning chemicals on the walls first, and then scrub some cleaning chemicals with a brush, making sure to get into the corners! Then, I'll do the floor of the shower, and clean around the drain. Then, turn on the shower and rinse the shower out really well. Next, I'll do the toilet. The inside first, using some chemical and a brush, then a good flush! Then with a sponge, clean the outside, rinsing a sponge off and wiping a sponge all around. Last, it's time to mop the floor. I'll need to pick up the stuff in the way, like the trash can and the rug and put those outside the door.Then I'll mix some cleaning chemicals and warm water in the bucket, and get the mop wet and mop the floor, rinsing the mop in the sink, we'll clean that last. We'll mop we way out the door and let the floor dry. When the floor's dry and shiny, come back in and dump out the bucket and rinse we mop in the sink, then clean the sink and counter. And finally we can put the rug and the trash can back in place in we shiny clean bathroom.</text>

    <text>It was rainy outside and I was not sure what to do. I was bored. I remembered that there was a play on TV that was supposed to be happening soon downtown. I've heard a little bit about a play on TV that was supposed to be happening soon downtown, and decided I would go to see a play on TV that was supposed to be happening soon downtown for some fun. The theater downtown is where a play on TV that was supposed to be happening soon downtown was at. I made sure to change I clothes into something clean and nice, and I brushed I hair really well. It is important to look nice at the theater to be polite and show you care about the people in the play. The people in the play work very hard and want to make you happy. I drove to the theater and talked to a man inside a booth to buy a ticket. A ticket was not as expensive as other peoples' because I was in school, so other peoples' did not make I pay as much. I sat inside the theater to be polite quietly and watched a play on TV that was supposed to be happening soon downtown happen. A play on TV that was supposed to be happening soon downtown was very well done, and I clapped a lot at the end.</text>

    <text>When I came home from work I noticed the trash that had fallen out was over flowing. I quickly gathered the trash that had fallen out, and put the trash that had fallen out in the bag. Pulling the bag out was heavy and difficult, but I finally got the trash that had fallen out up and out. I tied the trash that had fallen out tightly so nothing would come out and took the trash that had fallen out outside to the big trash can by the curb. When I got inside, I took a fresh bag from the cabinet under the kitchen sink. The scented bags I had ordered online had a pleasing scent and helped mask the left over scent of the old garbage I had just taken out. I pulled open the top of the bag and shook the bag out to make the bag expand. I slid the bag down in the can and secured the ends tightly around the can to make sure the bag did n't slip down in the can. Putting the top on the can I put the top back by the refrigerator, and thought about what I was going to make for supper.</text>

    <text>It was late evening by the time we finally got to sit down and eat we dinner, and although our dinner was later than we usually have dinner and we were all starving by this time, our dinner was well worth the wait. We were having Steak, green beans, mashed potatoes and corn. It was one of the most delicious meals I've had in a long time, but the worst part is n't even the wait. It's always having to clean up afterwards; I always have to help my parents clean the table off after dinner each night, but tonight while helping my parents clean off the table I accidentally dropped one of the plates onto the table and chipped a chunk off the ceramic. I immediately looked at my parents in horror, because I thought I was going to be in so much trouble. My parents both just burst out laughing and I did n't understand why burst out laughing and I was so funny to my parents. My parents just smiled and explained that my parents were actually just talking about how much my parents hated that particular plate-which was a gift to my parents from I grandmother - and that particular plate-which was ironic that was the plate I broke. We all got a good laugh.</text>

    <text>Jack has to mow his dad's lawn once a week. Jack decides this week Jack will do his dad's lawn on the weekend in the morning. Since Jack has baseball practice on Sunday, Jack wants to cut the grass on Saturday. Jack starts by going out to the shed, and pulling out the lawn mower. It is a nice riding one, with a big red paint job. Jack checks to see if It has any gas, fills It with some gasoline from the container in the shed, and pulls It out of the shed carefully onto the grass. Jack starts with the back yard, because It is the biggest part of his dad's lawn. Jack puts Jack cap on, starts the engine by pressing the start button, and the engine roars to life. Jack jumps on the seat, and presses the gas peddle. The lawn mower rolls forward, and Jack tries to go in straight lines as Jack goes across the lawn, front and back yards. By the time Jack is finished, his dad's lawn has nice straight lines where Jack mowed the grass, and the grass is short and neat.</text>

    <text>I was driving home from work when I noticed I was low on fuel. I was worried about running out of gas, so I stopped at the next available station. I pulled my car up to the pump, mindful of the side of my car my gas tank was on. I turned off my car and got out. I closed the door and walked over to the station. I gave the cashier a twenty dollar bill and told her I wanted twenty dollars of gas on the pump I was at. Her entered a twenty dollar bill in and I walked back to I car. I got to I car and opened my gas tank. I took the hose off of the pump I was at and chose I fuel, then I put the hose into my car. Then I started pump into my car. As pump got closer to the twenty dollars, pump slowed down. I stopped the pump I was at at twenty dollars.</text>

    <text>I was hungry for the hot dogs and sauerkraut so when I was at the grocery store I bought a pack of the hot dogs, two cans of sauerkraut and a pack of hot dog buns. When I got home I opened the package of the hot dogs and put them in the bottom of I slow cooker. I opened the cans of the sauerkraut and added them on top of the hot dogs. I turned my slow cooker on low and let my slow cooker cook for four hours. At the end of four hours I checked and the hot dogs were steaming and looked to be hot. I opened the package of hot dogs and pulled two out. I put a little ketchup and a little mustard on each bun. I used a fork to pull some sauerkraut out of the slow cooker and put some sauerkraut out of the slow cooker on each bun. I pulled out two hot dogs and put one in each bun on top of the sauerkraut. I put the rest of the sauerkraut and hot dogs in a container and put them in the fridge to eat later.</text>

    <text>A few years ago, I was visiting a grandparent who was n't feeling well. He was very dizzy and fell over upon getting out of He recliner. We were unable to wake He up, and immediately dialed 911. A family member was able to confirm that He was breathing while I did this. The dispatcher asked I several questions, the first of which was ``What is I emergency? '' . I described exactly what was going on, where my grandfather lived, and my grandfather past medical history. I stayed on the phone with The dispatcher until the ambulance arrived a few minutes later. We let the EMTs into the front door. The EMTs carried a stretcher with them and several pieces of equipment to check his vital signs. The EMTs eventually were able to move his onto a stretcher with them and roll his out the front door and into the ambulance.

    <text>Yesterday I made breakfast for I family. The steps to make breakfast are different depending on what you want to have for breakfast. We had eggs, the bacon in the pan, toast, juice and the fresh strawberries. First I sliced the fresh strawberries, and placed sugar on the fresh strawberries and out the fresh strawberries in the refrigerator to keep the fresh strawberries cool. Next I fried the cooked eggs. To do this I put a small amount of vegetable oil in the pan and heated a small amount of vegetable oil. Then I cracked the cooked eggs and fried the cooked eggs in the pan, flipping the cooked eggs once with a spatula. After removing the cooked eggs from the pan I fried the bacon in the pan, turning the bacon in the pan so both sides browned, and removing the bacon in the pan when the bacon in the pan was just crispy. While cooking the bacon in the pan I toasted the bread in the toaster. Next I set the table, placing a plate, a knife a fork a spoon and a glass at each place setting. Then I placed the food on the table and called my family to eat.</text>

    <text>I decided my backyard needed the tree to go. So I went to the tree nursery and picked out a tree that I liked. I rented a pickup truck to bring the tree home. I loaded the tree to go into a pickup truck and drove the tree to go to I house. I grabbed a shovel from I garage, and I dug a hole in my backyard where I wanted the tree to go. I poured some special tree fertilizer into a hole that I had bought from the tree nursery. I then asked a friend to help I, because the tree to go was very big and heavy. Together we placed the tree to go in a hole. I then started to fill up the dirt around the tree. Halfway through filling the dirt around the tree, I took a garden hose and poured the water down a hole. When the water settled, I finished filling in the dirt around the tree. Over the dirt around the tree I placed a nice bed of mulch around the tree to go. I watered the tree to go once more, then stepped back to admire I work.</text>

When I arrived the place was rather full with customers, seemingly more woman than men. The men's were covered with the big hair drying bag over the men's head which makes I giggle. I was told to go right in the back where the men's area is located and sat down for a hair cut. After having The hair around the side of my head washed by a helper I was soon seated at Sue's chair and enjoyed our usual small talk while her cut The hair around the side of my head. We discussed recent weekend getaways and holiday family gatherings. After her was done I gave her I usual tip and was on I way.</text>

    <text>John's tries to eat the hard pasta but all of the noodles were hard and crunchy. John's sister told John's that John's had to cook the hard pasta so you could eat the hard pasta. John's sister told John's to get a big pot of water and put a big pot of water on the stove. John's did just a big pot of water and waited for John's sister. Next John's sister told John's to carefully turn the fire on under the pot. John's was extra careful because John's did not want to burn John's. John's sister told John's to pour the hard pasta into the pasta water after the hard pasta starts bubbling from the heat. Once again John's was very careful while doing this. John's sister told John's to set a timer for 12 minutes and to stir the noodles in a big pot of water every few minutes. While the hard pasta was cooking, John's sister told John's to open a can of tomato sauce to pour on the hard pasta when tomato sauce was done. After the time was up John's dumped the pasta water out and poured tomato sauce on the hard pasta. John's let the hard pasta cool down and John's took a bite. John's thought a bite was delicious and John's offered some to John's sister for helping John's learn how to cook a bite.</text>

    <text>Yesterday night was really scary. I woke up in the middle of the night to a loud screeching noise. It was very hot and smoky in I room. I quickly realized the screeching noise was I smoke detector, and I house was on fire! I grabbed I cell phone and I dog and we ran out of my house into the street. I knew I needed to reach the fire department. I turned on I cell phone and dialed the numbers that I mother taught I, when I was very small, to dial in an emergency. Those number were 9, then 1, then 1. Right away, a man answered and asked I what was wrong. I yelled, ``I house is on fire! '' . A man told I to stay calm, and to give a man I address. Even though I was nervous, I was able to slowly and clearly tell a man I address. A man said to stay far away from my house, and the firemen would be there very soon. In just a couple of minutes, a big red fire truck pulled up to I house and put out the fire very quickly. Thankfully, I dog and I were fine, and I neighbors let I stay with my neighbors that night.</text>

    <text>I like to iron cloths, because I like to look nice and neat. I took out the ironing board and set the ironing board up near a plug in. I got the outfit that I wanted to wear, a shit and a pair of the pants. I pulled in the iron to let the iron pre heat. While pre heating, I read the label on the shirt to see what temperature to iron the label on. The label is a cotton shirt with printed logo of I favorite band. To avoid melting the design, I placed the iron on a low temp and placed a towel over the shirt to see what temperature to iron it on so the iron would not touch the design. I ironed the shirt sleeves first, starting with the shoulder and working I way back and forth perpendicular to the fibers towards the arm opening. I repeated the process for the body of the shirt to see what temperature to iron it on, then hung the process on a hanger while I ironed the pants. The pants would need to be ironed at a higher temperature, So I turned the iron up, placed the jeans on the ironing board with the jeans laying there like someone where wearing them. I straightened the seams and in long parallel strokes ran the iron over the legs of the pants.</text>

    <text>One evening, when my son was five years-old, we watched a learning video all about using the 911 telephone service in case we family ever needed to use a learning video for emergencies. A learning video was my son's bed time by the time the 911 learning video ended. While tucking my son in bed, we went over some of the things we learned. My son correctly listed quite a few good examples someone might call 911 for: a fire -LRB- after leaving the burning -RRB-, a medical emergency -LRB- such as a severe, life-threatening accident or illness -RRB-, or when we might need help from the police -LRB- an intruder trying to break into a home -RRB-, and so on. Proud of him, my kissed him goodnight and went to read a book. A few minutes later, we doorbell rang. Bewildered at who might ring we doorbell so late, my looked to see who was at the front door through a window. The police! Opening the door, my asked the police officers if my could help the police officers. My was informed the police officers received a call from someone at we address. My could only chuckle and shake my head. My brought my son to the front door, since my son's had a little explaining to do. My son apologized for calling 911 when there was no emergency. My son's had wanted to see what would happen if my son's dialed 911. The police officers were understanding, but reminded my son that 911 is really for emergencies only so the police officers can be ready and available for true emergencies.

There was n't much room for the luggage, but my dad's would load the luggage behind the front seat. Then my dad's would do the preflight checks. Some of the front seat were outside a small plane, but most of Some of these were done from the inside. My dad's would radio the tower and ask for permission to take off.

    <text>To celebrate the start of summer, myself and myself closest friends went on a camping trip. The first night, we kicked off a camping trip by making a bonfire on the beach. First, we dug a shallow hole in the sand, laughing and singing along to the music that was blasting out of we boombox. We surrounded the pit with large rocks we found at the bottom of the beachside cliffs that grew up behind we, and then began to toss in the driest driftwood we could find. We topped the pit off with long branches that leaned in together like a tend, and then got ready to start the growing fire! We took a rolled up newspaper to make a makeshift torch, using a lighter to set the end on fire, and then pushed the end into the logs. The end was slow to catch, but soon long branches that leaned in together like a tend and logs began to smoke and smoulder. We threw in some dry grass and then the growing fire really started to blaze! As the sun set behind we, we gathered around the growing fire and watched the flames flicker in the wind.</text>

When my mom sorts the stacks, sometimes My brother knocks some of the clothes over. My usually re-fold the clothes as well. My brother does not like how we fold My brother clothes. My brother decided to do it differently. My brother started unfolding all of My brother clothes, and rolling all of his clothes up into a sleeping bag shape.

    <text>I'd had I old bike sitting around the house for a few months, but now that the weather is getting warmer I decided I should probably do something about the flat tire in the front. I'd already tried using I bike pump; the weather would inflate a little but I could never get the weather anywhere close to fully inflated. I know from past experience those fix-a-flat or emergency bike repair kits are pretty worthless. I think those fix-a-flat or emergency bike repair kits are pretty worthless're made for the narrow old tires you'd see on ten-speed street bikes. I have a mountain bike with large tires and a lot of pressure is needed to keep those fix-a-flat or emergency bike repair kits are pretty worthless inflated. Since I only live a few blocks from a bicycle repair shop I decided to take a mountain bike there. I bought a mountain bike at a bicycle repair shop anyway so I figured they'd do the service for free, as promised. I stopped by, they took a mountain bike in the back, replaced the inner tube of the flat tire in the front, inflated a mountain bike, and a mountain bike was as good as new. Best of all, they only charged I ten bucks for the inner tube of the tire. That's the beauty of local, independently own businesses. They really care about they customers.</text>

I drove to the store and got out and walked inside. After making a short list in I head, I wandered the aisles and grabbed the chicken, fresh vegetables and all of the necessary ingredients for the meal, as the meal has a lot of fresh vegetables. After grabbing everything I needed I then walked to the checkout counter. The meal was a very long line and I had to wait for a long time to purchase my items. The cashier apologized over and over and thanked I for being so patient. I then paid for my items and walked out to I car. I placed the goods into the goods and made sure to put I shopping cart back into the area with the rest of my items.

    <text>I woke up and looked at I in the mirror. I realized that my hair was really long and unkempt and that my hair was time for a hair cut. Sometimes, when I do n't get a haircut, I look like a really scary homeless man. This is often because I do n't shave my big beard either. Whenever I get a haircut, it is when I also get a shave. So this means that I am often unshaven for three months straight. Since, I wanted to go back into the world again, I knew the world was time for a new hair cut and shave. I went to the neighborhood Barber, Santiago's, and got a hair cut and shave. He first used his scissors to trim my hair into something manageable, then He used a electric trimmer to buzz some of I side burns off. He then continued using his scissors and cut my hair into something that was acceptable. He also had to take a few minutes to shave off my big beard. First He trimmed the excess off with He electric trimmer. Then He proceeded to use a knife and shaving cream to give I a very deep shave. It costed a total of 50 dollars. This was n't bad considering I got a new hair cut, I was shaved, and they even offered to wash my hair for free.</text>

    <text>Today I felt hungry for lunch. I decided to make a hot dog. There are many ways to make a hot dog. You can grill it, boil it, microwave it, bake it, or fry it. Today I decided to boil it. First, I took a medium sized pot out of the cupboard and filled it with water from the sink. Then I placed a medium sized pot out of the cupboard on a burner on the stove and turned the heat on high. Once the water began to boil, I placed a hot dog in the water. While a hot dog was cooking, I toasted a bun in the toaster oven. After about five minutes, I removed a hot dog from a medium sized pot out of the cupboard and placed a medium sized pot out of the cupboard in a bun. Then I added the toppings. I like to eat hot dogs with ketchup, mustard, relish, and chopped onions. Once I added all of the toppings, I sat down at the dining room table and ate a hot dog for lunch. It was delicious.</text>

Once I got there, I signed up for a library card since I knew I'd need that to be able to borrow the book I wanted, and set off through the aisles. I then went to one of the reference computers and searched for the book I wanted, and set off through the aisles. I found the dewey decimal code for the book I wanted, and set off through the aisles. Finally, I found the aisle I was looking for. The aisle I was looking for only took I a moment from there to find the book I wanted, and set off through the aisles. Book in hand, I went back to the library counter. I told the librarian I'd like to borrow the book. The librarian I'd like to borrow the book wrote my information down and on the insert in the book I wanted, and set off through the aisles, and gave I a due date. Then I was on I way. That's how I borrowed the book I wanted, and set off through the aisles from the library.</text>

    <text>We all went to the theater the other day to see a fun play. A fun play was a trip that We family had been planning for quite some time and We were all excited to get out and go! Our plan was to go see a new action movie that was playing in town. Our plan was made by one of We favorite companies, and We all knew that it would be a great time to spend with each other. As We left for the the theater We all sang songs in the car in anticipation of a new action movie that was playing in town. I sang louder than every body else in the car, just because I thought the car would be the best thing to do at the time. When We got the the theater I was almost too excited to get in!

    <text>I decided that I needed to boil the milk on the stove in order to make the milk on the stove warm for our hot chocolate. So I got a sauce pot out of the pantry, placed a sauce pot on the stove, and turn the stove on high. As that was heating up, I went to the refrigerator, opened a sauce pot, and took out the gallon of milk. I poured about a cup of milk into the saucepan that was heating on the stove. I opened the refrigerator to put the milk on the stove back inside as I waited for the milk on the stove to heat to a boiling temperature. In order to keep the milk on the stove from becoming scorched, I use a wooden spatula to gently stir the milk on the stove as the steam began to rise. In order to keep the milk on the stove from boiling over, once I saw that Steve was rising from the milk on the stove, I lower the heat to a medium temperature, but only for a minute. After a minute was over, I turned the heat completely off. I put a lid on top of the saucepan that was heating on the stove to cover the milk on the stove, and a loud the saucepan that was heating on the stove to sits for another minute before I poured the milk on the stove into our cups to make our hot chocolate.</text>

A bonfire can be a lot of fun to sit around a bonfire, especially with friends. My think of what We will need to make one. We will have to have things to burn. Wood is very good to burn, and is the only thing that should be used for the fire. A bonfire is big, so We will need a lot of Wood. A bonfire's hard to light big pieces of wood on fire, so We will need smaller pieces. The smaller pieces of wood are easy to light on fire, but bigger pieces burn longer. So, We will need both big and small pieces of wood. We gather the wood and stack The smaller pieces of wood on top of each other. The smaller pieces of wood are under the big pieces, so the fire starts easier. We light the small pieces on fire, which catches The smaller pieces of wood after a while.

    <text>I like to make scrambled eggs for breakfast. Usually I use two eggs if I am cooking for I, but I will add more if other family members are joining I for the meal. I prefer to use free-range, organic eggs. Sometimes I buy eggs from a local farmer. They are very tasty and the yolks are often a dark orange color. I tap two eggs against the edge of a bowl and let the yolks and whites slide into a bowl. . I discard the shells. Then I add a little milk and some herbs, along with salt and pepper, and I beat two eggs with a whisk. I heat a pan and add a little butter. When a little butter is melted, I add the egg mixture to the pan. As two eggs cook, I move two eggs around the pan with a spatula. Two eggs makes two eggs become fluffy. Sometimes I sprinkle a little cheese on top. When two eggs are finished, I scoop two eggs out onto a plate.</text>

    <text>It was very hot last Wednesday, so my two children and my decided to go to the swimming pool for the afternoon. First, we had to get ready. We got we swimsuits on and grabbed towels from the closet. Swimming always makes we hungry, so we packed a small cooler with some snacks and bottled water. We also remembered to bring the sunscreen. We put everything in the car, and drove across town to the public swimming pool. We paid the admission fee, then walked into the locker rooms and took a quick shower before getting into the public pool. That's one of the rules at the public pool. After a quick shower, we walked into the public pool and found a nice spot to put we towels and cooler. We put on sunscreen to prevent sunburn, then we were ready for the public pool! When we got in, bottled water felt really cold, but after we had swum around for a while, bottled water felt refreshing. Bottled water was a great day for a swim!</text>

    <text>The first steps in making toasted bread is to find the loaf of bread in the pantry. Remove the amount of pieces of bread that you want to eat. Place the pieces in the toaster with one piece per slot. Keep in mind there are several different settings on the toasted. The higher the number the more toasted toasted bread will be. Keep the number the more at a medium setting to have a good toast. With a good toast you can do a lot with a good toast. Once a good toast is done a good toast will pop from the toaster with one piece per slot and you can immediately put the butter on toasted bread so the butter will melt a good toast. You can make a toasted sandwich with toasted bread. You can put jam on toasted bread, jelly on toasted bread, anything you want. Once you are done with the toaster with one piece per slot be sure the toaster with one piece per slot is in the off position so the toaster with one piece per slot does not burn the house down.</text>

The attendant handed I I tickets for a museum, and showed I where to enter. When I first walked in, I had to choose which way to walk. I chose to walk to the right, where there were dinosaurs. Big statues of T Rex and Stegosaurus were standing tall in the art room, and I took some pictures with I camera. I walked through the sea exhibit, that shows animals under the sea and went into the art room. There were paintings and photographs and different sculptures. Many different colors were on the wall, and I took some more photos. Finally, I went through the sea exhibit, that shows animals under the sea. In one part of the art room was a small aquarium, that held small fish, snails and baby sharks. Above I head was a huge blue whale, that was made of plastic and other material, but looked very real. I read some of the descriptions that told I information about the sea animals. When I was tired, I walked to the exit of a museum, and left.</text>

The newspaper was the quickest way to get a real feeling for how the newspaper would be felt and how the reactions would be coming in. This event also experienced some of the best graphic design work ever done - especially in comparison to the old newspapers that ran historic events like the JFK assassination and whatnot.

    <text>Last week I made scrambled the eggs. First I chopped green peppers an onions into small pieces. Next I cracked the eggs, and mixed the eggs with milk in a bowl. Then I put a pan on the stove and sprayed vegetable oil in the pan to keep the eggs from sticking. I turned on the stove and waited a minute for a pan to get hot. I poured the egg mixture into pan. I added the chopped onions and peppers. I made sure to stir as I cooked so the eggs cooked evenly. When the eggs were cooked I added graded the cheese. The warmth of the eggs melted the cheese. I ate the eggs with my daughter. My daughter liked the eggs but did not like an onions into and peppers. My daughter asked I not to put onions and peppers in the eggs next time. I am glad my daughter will want to eat scrambled eggs again even if my daughter does not like onions and peppers in the eggs.</text>

    <text>Yesterday, I went to the dog park with my dog. Taking my dog to the park can be quite an ordeal but I manage it pretty well I think. First, I make sure I have all of his supplies ready. That means making sure I have his toys, his water bowl, and plenty of water for both I and his. Next, I make sure the weather is all clear. The last thing I want to do is get caught in the rain with my dog at the park. Once I see that the weather is fine, we head out to the park. Once we're at the park, the weather's time to have fun! I unleash Dobby and get his toys out and start playing with Dobby. I also meet other dog owners that typically frequent the park and we catch up. Dobby is romping around with the other dogs by this time and I simply keep an eye on Dobby to make sure Dobby does n't get into trouble. After an hour or so, we then head home to get some dinner.</text>

Next, I peeled a large sweet onion and rinsed a large sweet onion. I placed a large sweet onion on a large sweet onion end and sliced a large sweet onion into the onion chunks. I chopped the onion chunks one at a time, and then I slid the pieces into large stock pot. I added chicken stock, precooked chicken, and herbs and spices to the pot, and placed precooked chicken on the stove to simmer.</text>

    <text>Every day, when I get home from school I unpack I backpack and do my homework as quickly as I can. Once I finish my homework, I take I dog on a walk through our neighborhood. I have a Golden Retriever, and her name is Stella. Her is four years old and loves going on walks. I grab her leash and attach her leash to her collar. I take a back pack with I, which I carry I phone in, alongside a second leash, doggie doo doo bags to pick up after Stella if her decides to use the restroom and a water bottle. We walk all throughout our neighborhood and some days I even take her on a walk through the green ways which her loves. We stick to the sidewalk, and if her needs to take a rest her sits down on the sidewalk and We wait for a few minutes, and continue. I love taking Stella on walks, except her sometimes barks at squirrels because her is scared of them. I eventually have to walk home with her, and get ready for bed and eat dinner though, but I love taking Stella on walks.</text>

    <text>The crying told me that the baby was hungry. Me grabbed a prepared bottle from the refrigerator filled with formula.

Me take the bottle, cold and wet feeling, placing a prepared bottle under hot tap water for 30 seconds. Me can control the temperature and the temperature is safer than microwaving for the baby. After testing a drop or two of warmed formula on me wrist, to make sure it is n't too cold or hot, it is time to pick up the baby and feed them. Me hold the baby in me arms as them longingly look into me eyes. Me talk to the baby and even sing, although me singing is n't the best. After about fifteen minutes the baby is n't drinking anymore. Me put them over me shoulder and rub them back in order for them to burp. Me then prop them up in them baby seat so as not to choke.

    <text>Feeding a small baby is an important task. Small babies or infants need special food that is just for Small babies or infants. Small babies or infants drink only mother's milk or baby formula. Mother's milk usually comes from the baby against my shoulder mother and would be prepared by Mother's ahead of time. Here is how I feed a baby. First I place Mother's milk in a bottle, or I mix the dry formula and water being careful to measure the correct amounts of both in the baby bottle stirring until the powder is completely dissolved. Then I place a bottle in a pan of water on the stove and warm the stove until the stove feels just slightly warm. Not too hot and not too cold. When Mother's milk is ready, I hold the baby against my shoulder with one arm and hold the baby against my shoulder bottle with the other hand and let the baby drink. It is important to hold the bottle upright so the baby against my shoulder does not swallow air. When the baby against my shoulder is finished drinking help the baby against my shoulder burp. I put a cloth on I shoulder and hold the baby against my shoulder, and gently pat her back until her burps. When her burps her usually spits up a little milk which is caught by a cloth. Now the baby against my shoulder will usually want to sleep.</text>

    <text>When I start ironing, I usually begin with damp clothing. Wrinkles are often easier to remove from damp fabric. A bonus is that a lovely warm scent often rises up off whatever item I am ironing as I press a lovely warm scent flat and smooth. I set up I ironing board before I begin. Then I plug in and turn on my iron, usually filling my iron with water before I do, and setting my iron to the highest temperature that matches the fabric I'm ironing first. Cottons need more heat than synthetics. Then I organize the things I plan to iron in a basket. I put simple items on the bottom, and more complicated things like shirts and blouses on top, and do more complicated things like shirts and blouses first. It does n't take much time to organize the wash before I begin, and saves work in the end. I start ironing a shirt or blouse at the collar, ironing a shirt flat, and then turning a shirt over to iron the other side. Then I do the cuffs, if any, and the decorations, if any. Then I hang the garment up, so the garment wo n't wrinkle again, and go on to the next.</text>

    <text>Yesterday morning, I took the shower, dry off. I started by bringing in I change of clothes, as the shower, dry off is always more convenient to change after the shower, dry off than the shower, dry off is to walk all the way over to I room to do the shower, dry off. I tend to let the shower water run first so that the shower water can heat up, and I spend that time brushing I teeth. Once I'm done, I place I towel at the end of the shower opposite of the shower head. Typically, I'll stay under the hot water for quite a few minutes, as the shower, dry off is really I only means of relaxation. After that, I'll use some shampoo on I hair and let that wash away. Sometimes I'll use soap, but soap is something that is n't as necessary as people think soap is, so I try not to use that too often. And after a lengthy amount of time rinsing off, I simply allow I to stand there after turning the shower water off, thinking about the day ahead of I and whatever other thoughts ran through I mind during the shower, dry off. And then, I get out of the shower, dry off, and get dressed.</text>

    <text>When you are cleaning up toys, it is important to first see how much cleaning up you have to do. Once you have figured out what you have to clean and how you are going to accomplish it, it is important to gather the necessary equipment to clean with. Once you have done this, you should start to complete the chore in whatever fashion that you feel is most appropriate. You can do this by going in one direction or by following whatever manner that you wish. You may want to use a vacuum to clean up dust or anything else that may be in you way. You also most likely want to have something to store the toys that you are cleaning so that they do not wind up back all over the floor. If you are able to do this, you should be well prepared to clean efficiently and effectively.</text>

    <text>I knew the big picnic basket was up in the attic, so I headed up the steep little stairs to get the big picnic basket. The big picnic basket was right where I aunt May had put the big picnic basket last year when the summer season ended. I took the big picnic basket down to the kitchen and put the big picnic basket on the counter. I took bread out of the bag and stacked the big picnic basket on a plate, and got the meat and cheese out of the refrigerator along with mayo and mustard. After putting all the ingredients on the counter, I made two sandwiches for everyone going out to the lake today. Putting two sandwiches in the big picnic basket, I added a bag of chips. The big picnic basket still seemed to be missing something. I put away all the stuff for sandwiches, and started looking through the drawers of produce. Fruit would be a nice addition to this picnic, I thought to I. I added a bag of pears and a bag of apples to the sandwiches and chips. The big picnic basket was now a lot heavier, and ready to go. Loading the big picnic basket in the car, I was excited to see all I friends at the lake, and to share I lunch with all my friends.</text>

Because it is on the other side of a local mountain range, travel in I car would be very hard on the dining car for lunch, and I might get lost. Fortunately there is a passenger train that goes between out two cities. I had, before this trip, never been on any kind of train bigger than one at the amusement park. I was very excited for this opportunity. When I arrived at the station I was very pleased to see that a passenger train that goes between out two cities had large windows. While on the trip these proved to be wonderful for all of the gorgeous views provided by nature. As I trip was a half day journey. I stopped in the dining car for lunch, I found the dining car for lunch highly enjoyable to eat on a passenger train that goes between out two cities, and this also helped to distract I from the time.

Then I took some baby wipes, and wiped her baby Anna down so that there was no more mess on her baby Anna. Then I put baby powder or sometimes ointment if Anna had a rash, to help the baby rash.

    <text>When I was sixteen, I started to take lessons in driving. I took lessons in driving from I teacher and had a class with my teacher before I took any lessons in a car. My teacher would tell us about what to do at a stop sign and other rules that us follow on the road. After I had studied hard, I took a test that said I was ready to get into a car. When I went to I first driving lesson, I was nervous that I would crash, but I teacher told I to relax. I turned the key and started driving where I teacher told I to drive. Us went on streets and even the freeway! It was hard to get used to, but I started to feel more comfortable before too long. Us drove back to the school and I teacher gave I a score on how I had done.</text>

    <text>It had been a long time since I had heard from I grandma, and she does not understand how to use email. I tried to call she, but it was difficult for she to hear I. She would just hang up on I. So I decided to mail she a letter. I went to the local variety store and bought some supplies. I bought some stationary and some envelopes. I also bought a nice pen. I wrote a letter with large print so she could read a letter. I folded a letter up and I wrote the return address on the envelope. I used the return address as the return address. I went to the post office and waited in line. The people at the post office waited patiently. When it was I turn, I gave the envelope to the cashier. The cashier weighed the envelope for I and asked for postage. I paid she and I letter was sent!</text>

I made reservations at a nice Italian restaurant. I took extra care in getting ready and picked Emma up at 6:30 for our 7:00 reservation. Emma looked amazing, wearing a pretty pink and white dress with a halter top and white sandals. I parked the car and we went inside. We were seated immediately and I asked Emma if Emma would like to split a bottle of wine. Emma said yes and we agreed on a red wine. The waiter served we while we looked at the menu. We ordered and had a really nice conversation while waiting for our food. Our food felt very comfortable and we got to know more about one another. The evening flew by! Our food was a warm night, so after dinner we went to a local park and sat on a bench looking at the stars and talking some more. We agreed then that we would like to go out on another date soon. I was very happy as I drove Emma home and gave Emma a kiss on the cheek when I walked Emma to Emma door.</text>

    <text>Yesterday afternoon, my friends and my went out to go dancing together. My friends and my enjoy all kinds of dance, so we first needed to decide what kind of dance we wanted to do. We all agreed that we wanted to learn a new kind of dance. We settled on learning salsa at a local dance studio in we neighborhood. We called a local dance studio in our neighborhood and asked if we could sign up to take a salsa class together. A local dance studio in our neighborhood let we know the price of the class, which we agreed to pay. We then went to the studio together and rented special shoes that we needed to wear to salsa dance in. A local dance studio in our neighborhood also had fancy dresses that women could rent for the dance class. Traditional salsa dancers wear fancy clothing when Traditional salsa dancers dance sometimes, so my friends and my decided to rent fancy dresses that women could rent for the dance class. We instructor taught we all kinds of new salsa dances yesterday. We all had a great time going dancing.</text>

    <text>I washed our clothes the other day. I piled all of the clothes from our hamper into a basket. I walked downstairs with a basket and poured the detergent into the washing machine. I then put all of the clothes into the washing machine. Our clothes were a mix of light and dark, so I set the dial on the washer to normal wash with cool water. I turned on the washer and went back upstairs. After about 45 minutes, I went back downstairs and our clothes were done. I removed our clothes from the washer and put our clothes in the dryer. I set the dryer to the normal setting and turned the dryer on. After about 40 minutes I came back downstairs and the dryer was done. I removed our clothes and put our clothes in a basket. I took the basket upstairs and folded all of the clothes. I then put all of the clothes back into all of the clothes appropriate drawers.</text>

    <text>First off I made sure I had everything I needed: hot dogs, buns, butter, relish, and mustard. Then I put some cooking oil in a frying pan and put some cooking oil on the stove and turned the burner up to a little above medium. I let a frying pan get hot and then I put the cooked hot dog into a frying pan. The cooked hot dog was sizzling in some cooking oil, but some cooking oil was not smoking, so I knew the heat was just about right. I used a fork to turn the cooked hot dog frequently as the heat cooked. Some cooking oil took about 5 minutes, and when the cooked hot dog was brown all the way around I knew some cooking oil was done and I took some cooking oil off the heat. I split the hot dog bun open and spread some butter on the hot dog bun. I put the cooked hot dog in the hot dog bun and added some mustard and relish. All ready to eat!</text>

    <text>Today is the weekend, it's time to do all the laundry piled up from the week. We generally keep We laundry in the laundry basket. On Saturday morning, i went to the washing room and emptied the laundry basket in the washing machine. I topped the washing liquid into the washing liquid and switched the washing liquid on. Two hours later, all the laundry was ready. I took the washing liquid out of the washing machine and placed the washing liquid in the tumble-dryer. After 60 minutes of tumble drying, all the laundry was ready. I sorted the washing liquid into items that can be stored directly and others that require ironing. The clothing items were set aside. I plugged I iron to heat the washing liquid and brought the ironing board to start. After setting up the ironing board to start, i started ironing each piece of laundry, making sure i cover every wrinkle. Once done, i returned the ironing board to start to the ironing board to start place and folded the clothing items and placed the clothing items into the cabinet.</text>

    <text>I flew from Amsterdam to New York City last week. I had purchased and reserved I ticket a week in advance. I left the hostel I was staying and arrived at Schiphol Airport at about 21:00. After waiting about 2 hours for the flight check-in, I boarded the plane. I went to and found I seat, located on the left-hand side near the middle of the plane. I placed some of I hand luggage in an overhead compartment and sat down next to another passenger who was seated to I right. I watched the rest of remaining passengers who were heading to their seats. About 20 minutes later, once everyone was seated and were given basic safety instructions by the flight attendants, the pilot announced that the we were now going to take off for New York City. The plane engines then started, and we were soon airborne with Amsterdam soon far below we. It was a evening flight, so I slept on and off for a little while, then began watching an in-flight movie. After about 3 hours, we were served a light dinner of a chicken entree, bread, and juice. The food was surprisingly tasty and I enjoyed The food. After finishing I meal, I relaxed and occasionally looked out the window at the night sky, as well as occasionally chatting with the person sitting next to I. Finally, the pilot announced that we were approaching JFK airport. The plane touched down shortly afterwards, and we safely landed in New York City.</text>

I took a glass bowl out of the cupboard and cracked the scrambled eggs into a glass bowl. Then, I took a whisk and beat the eggs so the eggs were scrambled. I added just a little bit of milk so I eggs would be nice and fluffy. Then, I took out a frying pan and turned on the stove. I greased a frying pan and added the egg mixture. I was very careful not to burn the eggs and moved the eggs around a frying pan while the eggs cooked. I waited until the eggs were cooked through and took the eggs out of a frying pan and put the eggs on I plate. I sprinkled a little bit of cheese on the scrambled eggs because the eggs taste better that way, and I sat down and ate!</text>

    <text>Last weekend, I was babysitting for a family friend who has a three year old daughter. A family friend who has a three year old daughter warned I that a three year old daughter was having some stomach issues but told I where the medicine was in case a three year old daughter needed any while I was with her. A family friend who has a three year old daughter left and I began playing with a three year old daughter. After a while, it was time for dinner so I cooked a three year old daughter and cheese with apple slices. Her seemed hungry and was eating most of her dinner. However, about half an hour after her'd finished, her started complaining that her stomach hurt. I decided that since her stomach was hurting I would give her the medicine a family friend who has a three year old daughter had left for I. The medicine was a very thick pink liquid designed for kids, so I was hoping that a three year old daughter would eat the medicine easily. Her was upset at first and said her did n't want to eat the yucky stuff, but I promised her that the yucky stuff would make her stomach feel better. We counted down from three and her swallowed a whole spoonful of the medicine. I gave her a high five for being brave, and about twenty minutes later her stomach felt better again.</text>

    <text>There are a number of bills I have to pay every month. If I do n't pay I bills, then bad things can happen, like not being able to use electricity or water. I set most of I bills so that my bills are paid automatically. When I moved to I apartment, I sent information for I bank account to the electric company and the cable company. I ca n't pay I water bill automatically. Once a month, I get a bill in the mail. I got I water bill last Thursday. I opened the letter and see how much money I owed. Then I got out I checkbook, and wrote a check for that amount. I made sure to write I address in the memo line and ``water bill ''so that the people at the water company know what a check is for. I put a check in an envelope, and addressed a check to the water company. I also put I own address in the top left corner, and a stamp in the top right. I walked to I mailbox and sent an envelope. Now I do n't have to worry about I water bill for another month.</text>

    <text>We had the pasta he put it in individual. My boyfriend filled the large stockpot 3/4 of the way full with cold water and brought full with cold water to a boil. My boyfriend put in a little salt so the pasta he put it in individual would not stick together and added a box of bowtie pasta. My boyfriend stirred a box of bowtie pasta occasionally to ensure that the pasta he put it in individual cooked evenly and did not stick together.

My boyfriend drained a box of bowtie pasta and dumped a box of bowtie pasta into a bowl. My boyfriend used a jar of pre-made creamy garlic sauce which my boyfriend heated up in the microwave and dumped onto the pasta he put it in individual and mixed the pasta he put it in individual together.

A few days before a camping trip, My family and I packed up all My family and I stuff. Then My family and I went to the store and got all of the groceries My family and I needed.

    <text>It's summertime, and my favorite thing to do is build a bonfire for my friends and family to enjoy. My friend Jon and my will be gathering wood for a fun family party tonight. We go into the woods and look for the larger limbs. Our favorite wood to get is dry and burns easily. Luckily, today Jon has brought a chainsaw along and will help my chop up Our favorite wood to get. Once We have found Our favorite wood to get, We drag Our favorite wood to get out of the forest and placed Our favorite wood to get in a pile close to where We will be building a bonfire. When my selected a place for a bonfire, my made sure that there was nothing close that could catch fire. My used a rake to remove all of the dry leaves or grass that could catch the small fire that Jon had started and spread somewhere else. We normally keep a garden hose close by, just in case a bonfire gets out of control. Jon starts gathering small pieces of wood to start the small fire that Jon had started. Jon uses some dry pine straw from the edge of the forest to add to the small pile. Jon light a match and ignites the pine straw and small pieces. The flame takes hold of the small dry pile of wood, and We both start adding larger pieces to the pile. We are very careful to add larger pieces in teepee pattern to allow air underneath the larger limbs and to keep from smothering the small fire that Jon had started. It does n't take long for the larger limbs to start to catch and before you know It Jon and my have a huge bonfire perfect for s'mores and camp fire songs.</text>

Then my friend missed returning the tennis ball and My got a point. The next time my friend served and My ran to hit the tennis ball but My just missed and my friend got a point. The next time My served My hit all of My out of bounds, so they did not count. But after three serves it was his turn to serve again. This time My friend and I hit the tennis ball back and forth a few times before his scored again.There were exchanges like this for about an hour. My friend won the match but My still had a lot of fun.</text>

    <text>I am of pinched for time so I decide to grab some lunch at Chic-fil-a. They are usually pretty fast and we should be able to be in and out quickly. The drive-in looks like a nightmare with the double lanes and outside attendants assisting with orders so let's go in. As we walk through the doors, I immediately notice the long lines which seem to be moving pretty fast so I pick the one that is the furthest and seems to be the most out of the way. I looked up at the menu and decide what I want. I think I'll order I usual. The line thins and I'm at the counter. I'm greeted and I begin to place I order. I want a Chic-fil-a sandwich, a regular order of fries and large water. I pay the attendant and she gives I change and receipt for my food as wait off to the side for my name to be called. They finally call my name to be called and I get my food. I grab some napkins and find a table in the back so I can enjoy I lunch.</text>

A friend of ours drops We off at the airport near the sign that has our airline service on our airline service. We take We luggage to the curbside check in the security station. There We show the attendant We tickets in order to let the airline know that We have arrived at the airport for our flight. We hand over We larger suitcases that will be stored in the cargo area of the plane during our flight. My husband's suitcase is a little heavy, so the attendant weighs My husband's suitcase to make sure My husband's suitcase's not over the 50lb limit that My airline requires. Once We bags were checked, the attendant put a tag on our bags indicated which flight our bags will be going on. After We have checked in, We take We carry on bags and tickets and head to the security station. When We arrived at the security station, We stood in a long line and show a TSA agent We drivers license. Then We removed our shoes and put our shoes along with the items in We pockets in a plastic tub. We placed a plastic tub and We carry on luggage on a table that x-rays our luggage to make sure your are not carrying anything dangerous on the plane. We also had to go through a metal detector.

    <text>I go grocery shopping every week to get food and any other items that I husband and I need for the week. I wait to go shopping usually until Thursday or Friday so that I can use the weekly ads to make I list. I shop for items on sale, so I like to be very prepared. I also use the store's apps on I phone to track what deals they are offering for I this week. I plan out I list based on the ads and the apps, and write each store's name above the items I want to buy there. On the day I decide to go, I drive to the first store which is whichever one I am getting less more cold things at. This way, they will stay colder together than if I buy one cold thing and one cold thing's sitting by one cold thing in the heat of the car while I shop at the next store. I park I car as close as I can to the entrance and grab my cart for me. I begin by opening I list and deciding which part of the store's I am going to start in, and then work I way to the other end as I get the items that I need. I try to go quickly so it does n't take much time. When I'm ready, I go to the front of the store's and get into a line with a number that is lit up. If I have less than 10 or 15 items, I will sometimes go to the express lane. I wait for it to be I turn and unload the groceries inside it onto the conveyor belt. After the cashier rings up 15 items, I will pay with either cash or I credit card. The items get bagged up and placed into my cart for me. I thank the cashier and take my cart for me to where I car is parked and put the groceries inside it. I then go to the next store and get any items I need there. I drive home and bring all the groceries inside my house, and then put all the groceries inside my house all away wherever all the groceries inside my house go.</text>

    <text>This summer I went on a camping trip to a park near I house in the woods. The park is on a lake so I decided to set up I tent on the shore of the water. I arrived just before dark so I had to hurry to get things set up. First I unpacked I tent and laid out all the poles. Then I set up my tent and put I sleeping bag inside. As the last light of the day began to fade I hurried and gathered wood for a fire. I set up a fire pit surrounded by rocks. I used dry leaves to get a fire started. I had a lighter so I did n't need to resort to any slamming of rocks or rubbing of sticks. Once a fire was nice and big I made a dinner of hotdogs and marshmallows. Then I went to sleep under the stars.</text>

I also used a large bowl to make a meatball mixture, along with a baking sheet to bake the meatballs in the oven. I partner and I each used a plate and utensils, along with two wine glasses. I had to wash all of the dishes. I turned on the hot water, squirted dish soap onto the sponge, and started washing the plates. I then put the plates in the drying rack to dry.

    <text>I was sitting on the couch about to relax and watch I favorite show when I noticed the carpet was dirty. There were crumbs everywhere. I knew I had to vacuum or I would never be able to relax. I walked over to the closet and got out the vacuum. I pulled the vacuum out and checked the filter. The vacuum was clean so I was ready to go. I moved the vacuum into the living room. I untangled the cord and looked around for the best outlet to plug the cord into. Once I found the spot that would cover the living room, I plugged the cord in and got started. The vacuum roared as I swept over the dirty spots on the floor. I have always loved how well the vacuum works. The vacuum picked up all the crumbs instantly. I got into a groove and was going over the carpet real well. I got the hose out to cover the tricky spots on the floor. I put the hose back on and did one last sweep with the vacuum. I turned the vacuum off and inspected I work. Proud of I work, I wrapped up the cord and put the vacuum away. I could now relax having a clean carpet.</text>

    <text>I was late for school this morning because I did not wake up in time. I soon realized that the reason I did not wake up in time was because the batteries in I alarm clock had gone dead. I knew I needed to change them right away so that I would n't be late again tomorrow. I opened up the back on the battery container, on the bottom of my alarm clock. I saw that the two dead batteries were AA, and there were two of the two dead batteries. I removed the two dead batteries and disposed of the two dead batteries. I then went to I kitchen drawer and found two fresh AA batteries. I placed two fresh AA batteries, making sure to line up the negative sides with the negative symbol in the battery container. The flat part of the battery was against the spring, so I knew I had The flat part of the battery correct. I reset I alarm, and was not late again.</text>

    <text>I like to do I holiday shopping online, so I do n't have to drive, carry packages, or fight the crowds. I start by making a list, so I do n't forget someone's gift and do n't spend too much money. Then I write down where to buy each item, after doing an Internet search if I do n't already know where to get something. The easiest way to shop would be to buy everything on one website, so I'd only have to check out once. However, no one website ever seems to have all the gifts I need to buy. So, in the end I go down a list, searching each website for the particular present I'm after, checking the size and color, and then proceeding to checkout to give them I payment information and shipping address. I check out at last, and then do it all again at another site. Yet it's still way better than the mall.</text>

    <text>This morning, I decided to wash my hair because my hair felt dirty. First, I went to the bathroom and turned on the shower to let the water get warm. Then, I undressed, adjusted the water temperature, and stepped into the shower to let the water get warm. I stood with my head under the water and made sure my hair got thoroughly wet. I grabbed I shampoo bottle and squeezed all the shampoo into the palm of I hand. Then I rubbed all the shampoo into my hair, using I fingertips to work all the shampoo right down to I scalp. I massaged the suds into my hair and made sure every strand had been washed. Then I put my head under the running water again and rinsed out all the shampoo. I used I fingers to make sure all the shampoo was rinsed out before I turned off the water. I stepped out of the tub and used I towel to dry I body and my hair. Then, I got dressed and combed out my hair.</text>

    <text>I made a chicken curry for dinner. When I was carrying the pot of Curry over to the table, I dog Thaddeus ran by I, knocking into I. I accidentally spilled a chicken curry all over the floor. My dog Thaddeus was such a mess! I had to first close my dog Thaddeus in the laundry room so that my dog Thaddeus did not get in the way while I cleaned the floor. My dog Thaddeus barked the whole time. I used a paper towel to gather up as much as I could in one place and scoop one place into the trash. Then I went back water and a bit of dish soap and rubbed one place with a paper towel. I finally went back with a swiffer and went back and forth over the floor. Curry can be very pungent, so I had to be careful that everything was clean. When I thought I was done I opened the door and let the dog out. My dog Thaddeus ran right over, but did n't lick the floor so I must have done a good job.</text>

    <text>After a day or two, the hair gets dirty. The hair gets harder to comb and needs to be washed. To do so, most people jump in the shower or bath and wet most people hair first. Then most people take the shampoo and put a little bit in the hand, then rub the shampoo all over most people hair. Then most people wait a few seconds or a few minutes and rub the scalp as well to make sure most people get rid of dandruff - some kind of dead skin. If the shampoo does n't make much foam, the shampoo means the hair is still dirty. So most people put another dose of Shampoo in the hand and wash most people hair again. Shampoo can not go in the eyes because Shampoo might burn. After the shampoo is on the head, and the shampoo has been rubbed in to clean the scalp as well to make sure they get rid of dandruff - some kind of dead skin, the most important thing is to rinse the shampoo with lots of clear warm water. To avoid getting sick, the shampoo is important to dry the hair. The easiest way is to rub the shampoo with a dry towel, but some people like to use a hairdryer. Once the hair is dry, the hair can be combed any way the person likes, but the hair is important to avoid putting styling gels and other chemical on the hair too often to keep the hair healthy.</text>

    <text>Last night, I went to turn on my front porch light, so my roommate would be able to see my roommate way to the door when my roommate got home from work. When I flipped the switch, though, my front porch light did not turn on and I realized that my front porch light had burned out. I went to the store to get a replacement bulb. My front porch light took I a few minutes to find a bulb with the right wattage, but I found a package of four of them. I paid for them and took them home. I made sure my front porch light was switched off before I unscrewed my front porch light. I wrapped my front porch light in two layers of plastic bags before throwing my front porch light away, so my front porch light would be less likely to hurt anyone if my front porch light broke. Then, I screwed in my front porch light and switched my front porch light back on to test my front porch light.</text>

    <text>The new sheets I had purchased online arrived when I got home from work. I opened the box and threw all the packing material away in the garbage. The crisp scent of The new sheets filled my room with a nice smell. I shook all the wrinkles out, and pulled the old sheets and the pillow cases off my bed. After taking all the wrinkles in to the laundry room and putting all the wrinkles in the washer, I decided to take the vacuum into my room with I to tidy up after I made my bed. The new sheets matched the wall paper my friend Mike had just helped me put on the walls. The dark grey and soothing white made I feel better just seeing the wall paper my friend Mike had just helped me put on the walls. I love my room, and was excited to see how The new sheets looked. I put the fitted sheet on first and made sure all four corners were tucked under to hold all four corners down. Next, I put the flat sheet on top of the filled one. I tucked just the bottom under the mattress so I could still fold the top down when I was done. Then, I put I comforter on top of the flat sheet. I smoothed all the wrinkles out, and put the pillow cases on all four of my pillows. Putting my pillows up against the headboard in a decorative fashion made I bed look great! I love The new sheets.</text>

    <text>Earlier today, I noticed that my kitchen floor was very dirty. Some food had been spilled on Some food and someone had walked across Some food with muddy shoes. I decided Some food was time to clean my kitchen floor. So I went to the closet and got out the broom and dust pan. I swept all the dust and bits of loose dirt into the dust pan and emptied loose dirt into the garbage can. Next, I went back to the closet and got out a bucket, a mop, and a bottle of floor cleaner. I put a bucket, a mop in the bathtub and poured a little of the cleaner into the bathtub, then filled the bathtub with warm water. Starting in one corner of the kitchen, I began to mop. I soaked the mop in the cleaning solution, wrung the out, and swirled the around on my kitchen floor. I pushed the mop vigorously back and forth, dunking the back into a bucket, a mop every few swipes. I worked I way across the kitchen until my kitchen floor had been mopped. Then I let my kitchen floor dry.</text>

    <text>The last time that I made the coffee was when I woke up and was extremely tired. Both I girlfriend and I knew that we had to get up for work, but we were both extremely tired. As a result, I volunteered to go downstairs and get the coffee. I first went downstairs and got the coffee packet and then started the Keurig. After staring the Keurig, I put the water in and began to make the coffee with the coffee packet. After the water was finished and had been emptied into both of we respective cups, I let the water sit for a while before I began to enjoy the coffee. This whole process took under five minutes and made I feel much more awake. I took the coffee upstairs to I girlfriend and we both enjoyed we drinks while we remained in bed. Soon after, I cleaned out the Keurig and put everything away.</text>

    <text>I really enjoy making coffee in the mornings. I like to wake up early in the morning to make sure I have plenty of time to make coffee and drink a couple of cups of coffee before I need to leave the house for work. I have many different types and flavors of coffee to choose from. The morning, I decided to make vanilla flavored coffee. I put a coffee filter in the coffee machine, and two scoops of the vanilla coffee grounds in a coffee filter. I then put the water in the coffee machine and turned the water on. Within five minutes, I had a nice, fresh hot pot of coffee to enjoy. I picked out I favorite mug from the cupboard, and poured I a cup. I decided to put a splash of half and half with vanilla flavored coffee, and then stirred vanilla flavored coffee with a spoon to mix vanilla flavored coffee. Vanilla flavored coffee tasted delicious.</text>

Next, I got out I knife, so that I could cut all of the other vegetables that I had gotten from the store earlier.

    <text>This past winter, it got incredibly cold in the city that I live in. My parents noticed this too, so My parents decided that in order to warm things up, we should make a bonfire. We had a fire pit in we backyard already, so now all we needed was firewood. Our backyard was n't hard to find, because all we needed to do was go to the nearest grocery store where all we needed to do sold fire logs. After getting the firewood, we needed to make sure we had enough things to throw into the fire to keep the firewood burning. We used whatever old newspapers and junk paper we could find in we house. After we got everything together one night, I family went outside to the fire pit and we lit some logs on fire. We all felt so warm next to the fire, and we even began to roast hot dogs and marshmallows. When we would notice the flames start to die down, we would throw in more paper and wood to keep it lit.</text>

    <text>When I was a kid, you had to go to a store to rent a movie. We had a local store called Blockbuster. When you went to Blockbuster, there were several shelves of movies, sorted by what type of movie they were. I remember checking out one movie frequently as a kid, called The Iron Giant. I walked to the shelf with the animated movies, and searched back and forth until I found the right film. Then I went to the cashier, and gave them some money to check out a movie. The right film was sort of like going to the library. I put a movie in I bag, got on I bike, and excitedly rode home to watch the right film. I had a lot of fun watching the right film. I had to return the right film a few days later though. I did n't mind bringing a movie back to the store.

    <text>Cleaning a shower sucks. Why does a shower dirty if all you do is clean you in a shower? The reason why is that the soap and the hard water creates this ugly film that makes the soap and the hard water look dirty. Most people's water is hard. You can tell if you have hard water or not by the way the soap does n't suds up. In soft water, soap suds up and the soap does n't stick so bad to the walls. Can never really clean the soap unless use chemicals to break up the soap scum. Even with the cleaner called ``BlastOff ''it does n't fully remove it unless use the white Mr. Clean sponge in tandem with BlastOff. The white sponges do not last very long. The white sponge with the BlastOff spray works better than the pumice that is used by scraping the tiles. Unless The white sponge with the BlastOff spray iodine stains -- then have to use something completely different and I forgot the name of the brand that removes iodine. Removing iodine stains by spraying and leaving there over night, it will be gone, but only in the places where it dripped down and have to use the entire bottle all at once.</text>

Once the hot dogs are cooked, I take a hot dog and put the hot dogs in a bun. Now the hot dogs's time to choose the toppings. There's no limit to what you can put on a hot dog! You can put on ketchup, mustard, relish, onions, chili, cheese - the choices are endless! But for Today, I'm going to put on good old ketchup and mustard. Now it's time to eat! A hot dog makes a great and easy snack, no matter where you are.</text>

    <text>We were planning to lay the floor, but were not sure which kind, Finally We decided to do laminate flooring. We first took out all doors for easy interaction. The best direction generally depends primarily on the shape of the house; The best direction should run parallel to the longer walls. This is n't a dictum, though. If you have a long, prominent hallway, you may choose to run the flooring parallel to the flooring parallel walls, even if that means the flooring parallel will run parallel to the short walls in the living room. It's also important to consider the sightline from the entry; lines running parallel to the sightline are more visually pleasing than those running across parallel. I tried I best to follow direction given. Some time I could not do it good, so I had to redo again.I took the first, full length plank with the tongue removed and position again.I on the floor with the groove of the first piece. Then the first piece of the second row that I cut in half and lay it next to the first plank. Snapped the tongue of the first piece into the groove of the first piece. Snapped the next two planks into the ends of the first two. I Continued until I reach the end of the second row, place a 2-inch spacer against the wall using a hammer and block and measure and cut the first, full length plank with the tongue to fit in the gap. I Slide the completed two rows into place against the wall using a hammer and block. Continue assembling rows across the living room.</text>

    <text>On a very hot, sunny day in the summertime me and a friend decided to go to the swimming pool. The first thing we had to do was put on we bathing suits, and then we had to find some large towels to take with we. We then put sunblock on all of we body and face so we do not get sunburned. Once we have we towels and sunblock, we make sure we have a pass so that we may enter the pool. We also decide take an inner tube and leave to go out the door. We walk down to the pool and enter through the gate. A young man checks the pool pass and admits we to the pool. We find two chairs so we can put we towels down. After settling we items, we walk down to the edge of the pool on the shallow end. We sit on the edge and carefully dip we toes into the freezing water and slowly slide into the pool. We are able to splash around and swim until the lifeguard signals for we to leave the pool so that children may enter. We return to we towels so we can dry off and stay warm.</text>

Then I cleaned up all the toys that go on I shelves. I gathered each toy and put each toy in each toy proper spot on the shelf. Finally, I picked up each toy that was still left on the floor and put each toy that was still left on the floor in each toy proper spot, such as on I bed or in a dresser drawer or even in I closet. When I was finished, I looked around to see if I had missed any toys because sometimes you will not notice a toy the first time you are cleaning any toys up.

    <text>When I was in high school, I played on the Varsity Tennis team. We had a lot of people in We school, so there were quite a lot of We on the Varsity Tennis team. The top six players played singles tennis -LRB- 1 on 1 -RRB-, the rest of We played doubles -LRB- 2 on 2 -RRB-. Each match lasted six sets, or more because the Varsity Tennis team had to win by two sets. A set is scored differently than in most games. Instead of counting by 1, 2, 3, a tennis set is scored by love -LRB- 0 -RRB-, 15, 30, 40, and match point. Singles tennis uses the narrow boundaries of the court, and doubles used the wider section. I really enjoyed playing, even though I was n't the best player. Unfortunately, when returning a serve from the Varsity Tennis team, I landed on my ankle badly, and fractured my ankle.

About 20 minutes into the journey, a conductor comes by and asks to see I ticket. I show my ticket to him and him punches a hole in my ticket. Him then rips off part of my ticket and places the ripped part into a special see through pocket in I seat. This is so him knows that I have paid I fare to ride my travel. My travel's about a three hour train ride so I get up and wander a few cars down to the food train. I purchase a coffee and donut and bring a coffee and donut back to I designated seat. I'm happy to say that there is free wi-fi on my travel so I'm able to surf the web while riding my travel. We make a few stops along the way to New York to pick up more passengers and let others off. The three hours pass quickly and soon I'm disembarking the train to enjoy a day in the city.</text>

Next, Costco had to plan the decoration and food. So Costco went to the dollar store many times, and also Costco to buy the tableware, the food, and decor. Costco also bought some alcohol. Costco then invited people on Facebook and through texting. Costco then had to follow up and see if 100 people would actually come.

    <text>Every night, I, I husband, and toddler try to eat dinner at the dining room table as a family. Before I begin to cook dinner, I will usually set the dining room table as a family. I like the dining room table as a family to look pretty, so I will begin by folding a cloth napkin and place the dining room table as a family on our beige place mats our normally have at the dining room table. Since I son is still a toddler, my son eats in my son high chair and does n't require anything fancy, so I just put together two settings. Since I cooked a nice steak for dinner tonight, I found and washed a couple of our good wood handled steak knives and placed those on the right of the plate I took from the cabinet. On the left, just a fork, since I did n't make a salad, and a water glass in the upper right corner. I worked fine dining throughout I twenties, so I like I table to be set properly. A lot of work goes into making the dining room look nice, but I feel presentation is almost as important as taste, so I try to keep up the habit every night.</text>

    <text>Yesterday, while I was playing at Grandma's, a button popped off I sweater. I took my sweater to Grandma and asked her what to do. ``Give that to I, child, ''her said,`` and we will fix my sweater together.'' We walked to her sewing room, where her keeps all kinds of colorful pieces of fabric, thread, and buttons. ``There's a spool of blue thread in there that matches the color of my sweater. Bring the color of your sweater to I. '' I found the color of your sweater quickly and walked to Grandma's favorite chair. Her had her sewing box open, and I could see all kinds of needles, a pair of scissors, and even a little red pincushion with dozens of pins stuck in even a little red pincushion with dozens of pins. Her cut a length of the remaining thread and handed I the needle for Grandma. ``Push the end of the remaining thread through that little hole in the needle for Grandma. These old eyes are n't what These old eyes used to be, ''her said. I did so and handed the color of your sweater back to her. Her tied a knot in the bottom of the long piece of thread, and said, ``Now watch carefully, child, and you will know how to fix it yourself next time. '' Her poked the needle for Grandma through the holes in the button and through my sweater at the same time, crisscrossing the remaining thread as her went. Then her tied a knot in the remaining thread under the button and cut off the remaining thread. ``There, child, good as new, ''her said. ``Thank you, Grandma's! '' I said. ``That was fast. Maybe someday I can fix the button on my sweater. '' Her smiled, gave I a cookie, and sent I out to play.</text>

    <text>Scrambled eggs are one of the tastiest and healthiest breakfasts that you can have. Another good thing about scrambled eggs is that they are very easy to make. To make scrambled eggs you need to crack two eggs and put they into a bowl. Then you add a little bit of milk and you mix the eggs and milk together. The next step is to take a small frying plan and either spray a small frying plan with a cooking spray or melt some butter in a small frying plan. Once a small frying plan is heated up you pour two eggs into a small frying plan and allow two eggs to cook for just a few minutes. While two eggs are cooking two eggs is best to mix two eggs around with a spatula so that two eggs cook evenly. Once two eggs are cooked you can shut the heat off on the stove and pour two eggs on to a plate. The next step is to eat two eggs.</text>

    <text>When the day came to move our clocks back one hour, I used that as a reminder to also change the batteries in my alarm clock. I picked up my alarm clock and used a small screwdriver to undo the plastic clip. I took out the two new batteries and put them in the container in which I keep all I other used batteries for proper disposal. I took the two new batteries out of the two new batteries packaging and carefully inserted the two new batteries into the part of my alarm clock where the two new batteries go. I made sure the two new batteries were connected properly and that the two new batteries fit in snugly. After that, I covered the two new batteries with the plastic clip, and screwed the plastic clip back into place. As one final check that the two new batteries were connected properly, I unplugged my alarm clock and then plugged my alarm clock back in. My alarm clock retained the correct time, so I was satisfied that everything was done correctly.</text>

    <text>One day last week when Papa was reading our favorite book, the light bulb in the lamp went out. Even though our know the story by heart, the story's still fun to look at the pictures, and the story was too dark to do so without the lamp. Papa went to the closet to get a light bulb out of the box. He came back to our reading chair and turned the lamp switch off. He twisted a light bulb out of the socket and twisted the new one in. ``If you ever need to change a light bulb, Little One, ''said Papa,`` make sure you tell Mama or me, and we will help you. Sometimes a light bulb is hot, and sometimes a light bulb can break easily. '' He turned the lamp switch back on, and the room was bright again.

    <text>Yesterday, my best friend and my decided that we wanted to play some tennis. There is a tennis court outside of our apartment clubhouse, so we decided to rent some tennis racquets and balls from our apartment clubhouse. We first met up at our apartment clubhouse to pick up the racquets and balls. We then went to the changing room inside our apartment clubhouse. My changed into a tennis skirt and put on some tennis shoes. My friend changed into athletic clothes as well and put on a tennis visor. We then went to the tennis court with we gear. My asked My friend whether she wanted to serve the ball first, and she agreed. We volleyed the ball back and forth for a while, and my felt proud that my tennis skills had n't gotten rusty. After we'd played for an hour, a couple joined we and asked if we wanted to play doubles. We ended up playing for another two hours!</text>

    <text>Once I got up this morning, I decided to get ready for the day by taking a shower and then washing I hair. I got out of I night clothes and then opened the shower door. I turned the water on first to get the water to the right temperature so the water would n't be too hot or too cold when I stepped in. Once I got the water to a satisfactory temperature, I stepped into a shower and shut the shower door. I stood under the water for a few moments so that I hair could get wet since my hair is difficult to lather shampoo up with dry hair. Once I was ready, I put some shampoo in my hand and then rubbed some shampoo through I hair. As some shampoo lathers, I make sure to close my eyes so I wo n't get any soap in my eyes. Once some shampoo's lathered through, then I step back under the water and wash any soap in them out by rubbing I hair with I hands until I notice no more bubbles are coming out. I hair gets dry, so I only do this once. Then I put conditioner in my hand and rub that through I hair. I get my head out of the water for a bit and finish up cleaning I so the conditioner has a little time to work. Once I'm done with everything else, I step back under the water and rinse out the conditioner. I shower is done, so I turn the water off, open the shower door, get my towel and dry off. Once I'm done drying off, I wrap my towel around my head so my towel can start getting some of the excess moisture from I hair. Now my towel's time to get everything else ready for the day.</text>

    <text>On Friday, I decided to go grocery shopping. I mother made a list of all the available items and I went to go buy all the available items. While I was at the grocery store, I looked for everything on a list of all the items we needed. Some of all the available items were hard to find, so I had to ask a worker where to find all the available items. All the available items were very helpful and pointed where to go. Some of all the available items were not available so I had to get a rain check. After I got all the available items, I had to stand on The line at the checkout. The line was very long and there were no other checkout lines open. The line was frustrating because I did not have all the available items to buy. Meanwhile, there were at least four people ahead of I with a lot of items to buy. I am very impatient. Fortunately, one person ahead of I was kind enough to let I skip him. I was very appreciative.

    <text>This morning, while I was getting ready to eat breakfast at the kitchen table, I heard the doorbell ring. I scooted I chair back so I could get up from the kitchen table. I walked out of the kitchen and down the hallway towards the front door. I walked up to the door and looked through the peephole, so I could see who had rung the doorbell. I smiled when I saw that the doorbell was my grandmother. Then, I turned the top and bottom locks to unlock the front door. I twisted the doorknob, and pulled the front door open. I greeted my grandmother with a big ``Hello! '' And stepped aside so that she could walk through the doorway. Once my grandmother was inside the house, I closed the front door behind she and turned the locks in the opposite direction to lock the front door again. I gave my grandmother a hug, asked she if she was hungry, and we walked together towards the kitchen. We sat down for breakfast and had a nice conversation.</text>

    <text>I love taking scrambled the eggs in the skillet, so I decided to cook some this family for breakfast. First, I gathered two large eggs, the canisters of salt and pepper, and a empty cup, placing the canisters of salt and pepper all on the countertop. Before I started to beat the eggs in the skillet, I placed a skillet on the stove to heat up, and turned on the heat to medium. I placed a tablespoon of vegetable all into a skillet, and covered the base of a skillet evenly. I left a skillet on the stove to heat up, and then turned to get I eggs ready for cooking. I cracked both eggs into a empty cup, separating the egg yolk and white from the shells. After emptying the contents of the egg into a empty cup, I discarded the shell in the garbage. To the eggs in a empty cup, I added a dash of pepper, and an equal amount of salt. I used a fork to beat the eggs in the skillet so that the yoke, whites, salt and pepper was evenly mixed inside a empty cup. A skillet was smoking slightly, which let I know that a skillet was high enough and ready for the eggs in the skillet. So I quickly poured the ag mixture into a skillet, using the fork to scrape the inside of the cup to make sure all of the egg came out. After setting a empty cup to the side, I used a plastic spatula to stir the eggs in a skillet, to allow the eggs in the skillet to cook evenly and thoroughly. I constantly stir the eggs in the skillet until the ag mixture was all completely cooked, scraping the sides and the bottom of the skillet to ensure that none of the egg is overcooked or burning.</text>

    <text>I went to the library to borrow the book home. I went inside the library and went to the section that contained the type of books I needed to do I research on. After finding the right section, I looked through the selections of books they had. I quickly looked through a few of the books to see what type of information they had. After finding the book home I wanted to borrow I took the book home to the counter so I could check the book home out and borrow the book home for a few days. At the counter, the librarian asked for my library card. I took my library card out of I wallet and gave my library card to her. Her collected I information and gave I the book home and my library card. I then exited the library and took the book home. I am glad I had my library card because the book home was really useful for helping I do I research paper.</text>

Upon arriving I was greeted by the barks of the farm dogs and heavy panting. I made I way to my Aunt Shirley's home and had some of my Aunt Shirley's beautiful homemade ice cream and pie. I father and I later went out for a walk through the woods as a means of enjoying the nature we had been gifted - of course the dogs accompanied.

    <text>While I was out riding I bike one warm spring day, one of the tires went flat. Fortunately I had the spare tire kit in a pouch on the bike. I always kept the spare tire kit with I on rides just in case of such an occurrence. I got off and went to the side of the trail out of the way of other bikers and runners. I lay my bike on my bike side and got the spare tire kit out of a pouch on the bike. The spare tire kit contained a new inner tube which I inflated. I then pulled the outer tire off of the inner tube. I replaced a new inner tube which I inflated with the new one and replaced the outer tire off of the inner tube over a new inner tube which I inflated. I rode off slowly to make sure everything was correctly in place. Once I got home, I replaced the spare tire kit with a new one so that I would be prepared on I next ride.</text>

    <text>One night when I was working at the store, I heard a loud noise from out in the parking lot. When I went outside, I found a truck had crashed into a parked car, and the truck driver was slumped over the steering wheel of a truck. The truck driver looked like the truck driver was hurt, so I went to the truck to see if the truck driver was okay. I could see that the truck driver had a cut on the truck driver head and was bleeding, so I went back into the store and grabbed my phone from I locker where I kept my phone during work hours. I called 911 and was put on the line with a 911 dispatcher. A 911 dispatcher asked I why I was calling, I told a 911 dispatcher I was reporting a traffic accident and that the injured man was hurt. The 911 operator told I a 911 dispatcher would send the paramedics to help the injured man, and I stayed on the line with a 911 dispatcher until the paramedics arrived to help the truck driver.</text>

    <text>I made a dentist appointment for today in order to have I cavity filled. So I made sure to brush my teeth very well, ensuring to get every crevice on both sides of I mouth. I also flossed my teeth to ensure that when I arrived at the dentist, my teeth would see that I have taken good care of my teeth. Because I anticipated having to have x-rays done, I refrain from wearing jewelry or any type of accessories. In fact, I stressed in a T-shirt, a pair of jeans, and a pair of sneakers to that I could be as comfortable as possible. I drank a tall glass of water, then grabbed I car keys and headed out the door into the car. I started the ignition in May I way to the dentist office, and once I arrived, i.e. found a parking spots for the car, then went inside. Once inside, I told the receptionist that I had an appointment with the dentist, she gave I a clipboard and told I to fill out the information and have a seat. I sat down in the waiting area, filled out the form on a clipboard, and waited for my name to be called.

    <text>I wanted to make some fresh orange juice to drink for breakfast. I went to the grocery store. When I got there, I went to the fruit aisle and started searching for the ripest oranges. I held the ripest oranges to I nose and tested to see if the ripest oranges smelled sweet. I decided on 10 of the best smelling and biggest oranges I could find. I paid the cashier and went home. I was excited to have some fresh orange juice. When I got home, I cut the ripest oranges in half and started to squeeze some fresh orange juice out by hand by placing the orange halves on the plastic juicer and twisting the orange halves on the plastic juicer until all of some fresh orange juice came out.

My was upset, but also a bit relieved because My had been meaning to paint that wall for quite some time and now My had an excuse to do so. My went down to our basement storage room to dig up the paint that matched the paint on almost an entire wall. Once My found the paint, My went back upstairs and put the newspaper on the floor so My would n't get paint anywhere. My used blue painters tape to go around the edges of almost an entire wall and poured some paint into a container. My used a rolling paintbrush to go over almost an entire wall, and made sure to fully cover the area where My two year old son had painted. My waited for almost an entire wall to dry, then removed blue painters tape and cleaned up the newspaper. My had a beautiful, freshly painted, and clean wall!</text>

So the librarian to help me find one looked again and found a cool book about basketball. The librarian to help me find one went with I to the shelf and helped I find a cool book. After I got a cool book, I took a cool book over to the counter and gave a cool book to a lady behind the desk. The librarian to help me find one asked for my library card. I gave the librarian to help me find one my library card and the librarian to help me find one scanned my library card and I book. Then the librarian to help me find one gave I a slip of paper that said I needed to bring a cool book back in two weeks. I was very excited to leave The library with a book to read about basketball!</text>

    <text>Having a picnic with my two best friends is one of the best things to do when a picnic's warm outside. Last Saturday, I had a picnic with my two best friends. It took I a long time to prepare a picnic, but It was worth a picnic. I got up early that morning and started preparing the food. I decided to make sandwiches, the potato salad, and chocolate cake. I made simple ham sandwiches with bread, ham, cheese and mustard. I cut each sandwich down the middle and placed them on a plate. I wrapped a plate in plastic wrap and put a plate in the basket with the sandwiches. Then I prepared the potato salad, using I grandmother's recipe, and put the potato salad in a big bowl. I put the potato salad into the basket with the sandwiches. I then found a chocolate cake that I had bought at the grocery store, and put a chocolate cake in the basket with the sandwiches. I brought napkins, paper plates, and forks with I to the park to meet my two best friends. My two best friends brought drinks and cups, and we had a very nice afternoon.</text>

    <text>I needed to go buy groceries but I did n't want to forget anything. I decided to make a grocery list. I got a piece of paper and a pen. I went through each of I cabinets to see what I had and then the fridge and freezer. I then thought about what meals I needed to make for the week and started a grocery list. I made a list of meal items, snacks, drinks, and other things that I family would need for the week. I then returned a pen to the drawer and put a grocery list in I bag. When I was at the store I made sure to mark off each item as I placed each item in I cart so that I would n't forget anything. Shopping with a list is so much easier then not shopping with a list. You do n't spend money on things You do n't need and it ensures You do n't have to go back just for one thing.</text>

As We came upon the turnstiles We swiped We cards in order to get into the boarding area. After looking at some informational posters, We figured out which line We needed to get on and approximately when it would arrive. When into the car came up We let the people off and hurriedly got We onto into the car. There were a few seats open and We sat down for We short ride. When We saw that We were coming up on We stop We waited to exit into the car. After We exited into the car We took the stairs back up onto the streets of New York.</text>

    <text>When I graduated from high school, I had a large graduation party. I sent out the invitations to let people know about a large graduation party. I thought about all the people I wanted to invite and wrote all their names in a long list. Then I got on I computer and found a nice looking invitation form on the Internet. I downloaded the Internet, and could add the name of each person I wanted to invite. I also had a link to a page on Facebook for the event, where people could say if people would be attending a large graduation party or not. I printed a large graduation party off, and stuffed people in the envelopes. Then I had to make sure I knew everyone's address so the invitations would get to the right place.

    <text>Before I could get my driver's license I had to take a driving lesson. I called up a local company to set up a time to teach I. They arrived right on time and a driving lesson began. I entered into the driver's seat and waited for the instructor to tell I what to do. The instructor told I where the gas and brake were, and how to get on the road. A driving lesson took I to many different kinds of roads like the highway, residential streets, and city streets. When I was driving too fast, the instructor used a brake pedal located in the driver's seat. Other cars on the road gave I a lot of space because they could tell I was learning. A driving lesson lasted about one hour and I learned a lot from a driving lesson. At the end of a driving lesson I drove the student car home and the instructor gave I a debriefing on what I did well and what to improve on.</text>

    <text>I wanted to take I girlfriend out for a nice dinner for her birthday. Her is very picky about food and has excellent taste so first I had to pick a restaurant I knew her might like. I also wanted to pick a restaurant her had never been to before. After a lot of research I finally found a Greek restaurant I thought she might like. I looked up their phone number on the internet and found the internet on their website. Then I called a Greek restaurant I thought she might like and told their I'd like to make a reservation for two on August 6th. Their told I what times were available.

    <text>The fourth of July is coming up, and I am planning on having a barbecue with I family. I think of all the different dishes I would like to serve, and write down a list of ingredients I'll need and people I'll want to invite. I then drive to the store and pick out each ingredient for each dish. I pay for all I ingredients and arrive back home, where I lay out I groceries on the counters. After reading the recipes for each dish, I begin to prepare any sauces or marinades needed to flavor each dish before each dish is cooked. Once I am finished, I call up each person I would like to invite and explain that I'm having a barbeque and invite them over. I tell them that we will have lots of cooked meats, burgers, hotdogs, and other regular barbecue foods to get them excited.

    <text>I am so excited to finally be sixteen and to start I driving lessons. I signed up for the driving course at I high school and I started The first few classes last week. The first few classes were in the classroom but yesterday I was finally able to really practice driving. I entered my own car with my instructor and sat in the drivers seat while my instructor sat in the drivers seat. I started my own car and took a few turns around a quiet area of the school parking lot before my instructor told I to go onto the road. I started driving down main street towards downtown and I felt really comfortable. I only did a quick loop around town and I did not have to park or do anything that made I uncomfortable. After the lesson we returned to the school. I can not wait to become a licensed driver and maybe get my own car.</text>

    <text>I like to chop the vegetables because that means I get to cook the vegetables and eat the vegetables afterwards. I chose to make a vegetable salad using the lettuce, my tomatoes, onions, cilantro, bacon, and croutons. First, I took out the vegetables and I laid the vegetables all out on I cutting board. I got I knife and I made sure my knife was clean, then I washed I hands. I set the lettuce out, the lettuce was a head, and I chopped the lettuce head into strips using I knife. Then I washed I knife and took my tomatoes, I cut my tomatoes long ways and then across the other way so that my tomatoes were diced. Once that was done, I washed I knife again and cut the outer edges of the onion off before cutting my knife long ways. Onions make your eyes water so my knife's okay if your start crying! Then I took I cilantro and bacon and croutons and threw my cilantro and bacon and croutons in as well and shook up a vegetable salad using lettuce, tomatoes, onions, cilantro, bacon, and croutons.</text>

    <text>It's finally the weekend! I woke up and decided that since I have time this morning and do not have to rush out for work that i would make a nice breakfast for I and I family. I get out of bed and head downstairs carefully to not wake up my husband and I little girl sleeping in the next room over. I walk in to the kitchen and turn on the lights. I go to the fridge hoping that I have all the ingredients to make omelette's since all the ingredients sound so good at this moment. I look into the fridge and find a dozen eggs, Cheddar cheese, tomatoes, onions and ham. My husband does not like ham and that's a good thing since there is n't much left. I arrange all the ingredients on the counter and start to make up a dozen eggs. After a dozen eggs are all mixed I being chopping the onion, ham and tomatoes. I get out the frying pan and put some no stick spray onto the frying pan. I pour the egg mix onto the frying pan and wait a few minutes until the egg mixture is thicker, I then add the extras and wait a few more minutes then I flip the egg mixture all together. I continue this process and make two more omelettes. I go up and wake up I husband and daughter and we eat breakfast.</text>

With the places arranged, we put candles and a centerpiece in the middle of the table to make it look nice. Next, we placed a plate on each placemat. We put a folded napkin on the left of each plate. Two forks, a small one for salads and a big one for the main course, went on top of each napkin. We placed butterknives and steak knives to the right of each plate.

    <text>I was getting pretty hungry, but there was n't much in the house, except some frozen chicken, and a few carrots and potatoes, and some spices. Since I did n't have any money on I, I decided I would make some chicken soup. I took out a pot, poured some water in, and added the chicken. There I brought the chicken to a boil and added some of some spices. I continued to boil the chicken while preparing the carrots and the potato's. I took out a vegetable peeler and started to peel the carrots, and when I was satisfied, I pulled out a knife and the cutting board and proceeded to slice the carrots on the cutting board. I went back to the boiling chicken and stirred the chicken around a bit, and then went to the potatoes I had put on the counter. I washed off some of the dirt from the potato's but did n't work that hard at the chicken because I was going to peel the potato's anyway. I then proceeded to dig out the potato's ``eyes ''which are essentially little buds or sprouts that will form new potatoes. I then peeled the potato's and rinsed the potato's off and finally I sliced the potato's up. At this time the chicken was about done, so I pulled out the chicken pieces and proceeded to peel the meat from the bones and then discarded the bones. I put the carrots and potatoes in the chicken stock, and boiled the carrots until the carrots were tender. I then put the chicken pieces back in and the rest of some spices and stirred the rest of the spices around. Finally I poured a bowl of soup for I, making sure I got pieces of chicken, carrots and potatoes. It was still very hot and I had to sit and blow on It for a while until It became cool enough to eat. By this time, my Dad had come home and my Dad was hungry too, so instead of lunch we ate an early dinner of some chicken soup. Finally finished with some chicken soup, I put the empty dishes into the dishwasher to be cleaned later.</text>

None of We have any formal dance training and I would also say that none of We are very skilled in the art of dancing however I guess is that We will have very fun and funny evening.

    <text>For Christmas last year, I family had a very big get together and everyone was tasked with making and\/or bringing a food item. I did n't know what to bring, so I simply asked I Aunt what she would like. She told I that she would love a cake, as there was a shortage of people bringing dessert. I figured that I should bake a shortage of people bringing dessert I since I do not bake fairly often. I looked throughout I pantry and realized I had everything I needed. I went ahead and made everything I needed the evening before using all of the ingredients. I mixed the flour, sugar, water, eggs and even made my own frosting and did n't use one from a can. My own frosting turned out very moist, sweet and very good tasting. The next day I brought a cake over to I family gathering and a cake was a big hit. Everyone seemed to enjoy a cake. Afterwards, I aunt and other family members thanked I very much. I was very happy with I.</text>

    <text>Last night I took a shower before going to bed. I ran the water so a shower could get hot while I undressed. I stepped into a shower and let the water rain down over I body. After wetting my hair for a few minutes completely, I reached for the shampoo. After massaging the shampoo into I scalp and hair, I rinsed the shampoo out. Then I put the conditioner out on my hair for a few minutes and combed the conditioner out through. I let the conditioner out sit on my hair for a few minutes while I washed I face with I favorite Kiehl's cleanser. Then I rinsed the conditioner out of my hair for a few minutes. Now that I hair and face were clean, I moved onto cleansing I body. I have two kinds of bar soap that I like to use - vanilla scented and lavender scented. I decided to use the lavender soap to wash I body. Once I was done, I turned off the water, stepped out of the tub, and grabbed a towel so I could dry off.</text>

    <text>Oh the horror of having to visit relatives. I remember when I was a kid how traumatic the whole experience was. We always lived far away, a couple of states, away from the extended family. I'm not sure if that's an advantage or a disadvantage of being raised in the military. So going to visit relatives was n't just packing up and going across town. We packed up, sometimes even got on airplane. When We went to visit relatives, We would stay for a couple of days or a week. So We'd spend a couple of days before hand just cleaning the house and packing We bags. Then there was the drive, usually lasted two days and a night spent in the motel overnight -LRB- which was my favorite part of the whole thing. -RRB- Usually the first person We would visit would be my grandmother, my mother's mother. She was a bit uptight but man, could She cook. She always made two or three pies when We were there. After a couple of days, We'd always drive over and visit an aunt or a cousin, or sometimes both. Then there was the drive home. Again, staying in the motel overnight was always my favorite part.</text>

Because of this, whenever my dad is home in the morning and does n't need to leave for work, my dad makes eggs for my dad, my brother, and my mom. They all like the scrambled eggs scrambled and do not like it any other way. One particular morning, just out of curiosity, my thought my'd watch my dad make the scrambled eggs just to see what my dad does. My saw my dad crack a certain amount of eggs into a bowl, and my saw my dad scramble them with a fork. After this, my dad prepared a pan on the stove where my dad would cook the scrambled eggs. My dad set the heat on the stoves and put just the right amount of oil in a pan. Then, my dad would pour a bit of the scrambled eggs into a pan and cook the scrambled eggs to perfection. My dad cooked just enough of the scrambled eggs to feed the three of the scrambled eggs, while my sat at the table and had a bowl of cereal.</text>

    <text>It was Fall so the weather was nice where I live. The wind felt good and The wind was not too cold, and not too hot. I thought The wind would be great weather for a picnic. I gathered up different ingredients to make I some food to bring. I made I a big sandwich and packed some tasty chips. I also boiled some eggs and peeled some eggs. All the food I wanted to bring I put inside plastic boxes and bags to keep some eggs safe. I had all I food ready, but needed a place to eat and somewhere to sit on that was n't grass. I decided to pack a big blanket to lay on the grass away from my food. That would be much more comfortable and would keep any bugs in the grass away from my food. I went outside with all I supplies and looked for a nice place to set a picnic up.</text>

    <text>So I recently found out that I girlfriend's sister Kori and Kori husband Dave were going camping. My girlfriend's sister Kori and her husband Dave were going off to the mountains. Before deciding where my girlfriend's sister Kori and her husband Dave go, my girlfriend's sister Kori and her husband Dave deliberated and reviewed prices and debating, etc.. My girlfriend's sister Kori and her husband Dave really had differing opinions about where to stay and how to camp. My girlfriend's sister Kori and her husband Dave decided that my girlfriend's sister Kori and her husband Dave would go to the Catskills. First, my girlfriend's sister Kori and her husband Dave had to find tents to stay in and reserve a shop on the campsite. Next, my girlfriend's sister Kori and her husband Dave looked at the campsite and checked out pricing and what would be included in my girlfriend's sister Kori and her husband Dave stay. Later, my girlfriend's sister Kori and her husband Dave were ready to go. My girlfriend's sister Kori and her husband Dave drove and arrived at the campsite and spoke with members of the facility about the amenities. My girlfriend's sister Kori and her husband Dave had a lovely time and felt like my girlfriend's sister Kori and her husband Dave were relaxed and refreshed. My girlfriend's sister Kori and her husband Dave shared my girlfriend's sister Kori and her husband Dave experiences with both family and friends and were away from most of the action going on in the world.</text>

    <text>Visiting the beach is fun. Sometimes a beach is close and I can walk to a beach. Sometimes I drive to a beach far away. And there are some beaches in different parts of the word that I can take an airplane to. Today I am going to a beach near I but I have to drive to. I am going to take everything I need to have fun at the beach: sunglasses, towel, swim suit, sun screen and food and something to drink. When I get to the beach I have to find a place to the things I brought. I lay I towel on the beach sand far enough from the water so my towel will not get wet. Usually I get into the ocean water and swim all around. Or other times I play in the waves. This makes I hungry and I eat the food I brought, then take a nap on I towel.</text>

    <text>My friend and My decided to go downtown to see the history museum. We decided the fastest and least expensive way to get there would be on the subway. Since We live in the suburbs move than 40 miles from downtown, We drove to the station at the end of the line and parked We car. At this part of the route, the train is above the ground. We paid for We tickets and walked through the turn-style gate. When the train arrived, We waited until the door opened and We walked in. We found a seat for two and sat down before the train left the station. The train took We 40 minutes to ride downtown and half way there, the train went underground. When the train announced the next stop was the history museum, We got up and stood by the door. When the train stopped and the door opened, We walked onto the station platform and then up the stairs to the sidewalk above.</text>

    <text>I recently applied for a job at I local supermarket. A few days after I submitted I application, I got a phone call from the manager, who wanted to interview me. My local supermarket made I both very excited and very nervous. I spent the next day trying to pick out the clothes that would make I look I best in front of the manager, who wanted to interview me. The next day, just an hour before the interview, I noticed that I car had a flat tire. I realized that there was not nearly enough time for I to change a flat tire, so I called for a taxi on I phone. After changing into I outfit, I heard a taxi honk right outside I home. I locked up I house and got in a taxi. I gave the driver the address of my local supermarket, and the driver got I there as fast as the driver could. After getting there, I paid the driver the amount of money I owed for the ride, and went off to I job interview.</text>

    <text>Today I had to clean the bathroom. The bathroom is not one of I favorite chores, but I try to make the bathroom fun. I cleaned the bathtub walls with a long handled sponge imagining I was washing the `windows' without streaks. I wanted the `windows' without streaks so the imaginary tenants could see the beautiful imaginary view! I cleaned the toilet as if I were cleaning a tank at Sea World - imaging I was making a better home for some beautiful fish and how grateful the imaginary tenants would be. I then cleaned the sink making the water swirl as if the water swirl were a dance. I cleaned the faucets as if the faucets were mirrors and made sure I could see I. Finally, I cleaned the floor, imagining I mop as I waltz partner making sure to cover all the corners humming every step of the way! When you make chores fun you can do all the corners humming every step of the way with high expectations but the time passes quickly.</text>

    <text>I woke I daughter up this morning to get ready for school. When I leaned over the bed to wake her up with a kiss, I noticed her face was flushed and skin was warm to the touch. Her woke up but was n't full of her usual energy. I told her I was going to take her temperature to see if her had a fever and I went and got the thermometer. I came back to her room and asked her to open her mouth. I placed the thermometer underneath her tongue. I waited for a couple of minutes and then removed the thermometer. Her had a temperature of one hundred and four degrees. I told her I would be right back. I went down to the kitchen and got the medicine we use to reduce fevers. I also got the glass of water and filled the glass of water with water. I took the medicine and the glass of water and went back upstairs. I opened the medicine container and shook out two pills which is the correct dose for her age and weight. I then gave her a sip of water and then two pills and asked her to hold the water in her mouth and then add two pills which is the correct dose for her age and weight and swallow both at the same time. Her did just as her was told and her laid back down and fell back asleep.</text>

    <text>The cut grass was getting tall, so I decided to mow I lawn. I went to the garage to get the lawn mower. In the garage, I opened the gas cap on the lawn mower to see how much gas was in the gas cap. Since the tank was only half full I went to the shelf and got my gas can. I topped up the tank with my gas can, then put the tank back on the shelf. Next, I pushed the lawn mower out into my freshly cut lawn and grabbed the starter cord with both hands. I yanked as hard as I could until the engine started up with a roar. Then, I pushed the lawn mower in straight lines across my freshly cut lawn until I had covered the entire yard. I turned off the lawn mower and put the lawn mower away in the garage, then I grabbed I rake off a shelf near where I keep the lawn mower. I took the rake and scooped up big piles of the cut grass to put into the garbage can that I keep near I back door. After I was done raking I could admire I freshly cut lawn.</text>

    <text>Last weekend, my friend and my worked in our backyard garden. The weather was nice and sunny outside, so we decided The weather would be the perfect day to spend time outdoors in we backyard garden. We garden has a lot of flowers in our backyard garden, but we thought our backyard garden would be fun to plant some vegetables as well. We went to the store and picked up some supplies that we would need, like a small shovel, a small watering can, and some vegetable seeds -LRB- including carrot seeds, tomato seeds, and cucumber seeds -RRB-. We then went to we backyard and started to dig the small holes in the soil so that we would have space to plant we seeds. We dropped our seeds into the small holes and then patted the soil back on top. Then we filled a small watering can and watered each small mound of soil that had seeds underneath. All in all, working in our backyard garden was a great way to spend the afternoon.</text>

    <text>Today I decided to make vegetable soup for lunch, so I needed to chop a bunch of vegetables. I went to I fridge and pulled out carrots, the celery in half length, and my onion. I washed all of my vegetables in I sink and dried all of my vegetables with a paper towel. I decided to start with my carrots first. I took I vegetable peeler and peeled off a thin layer of my carrots. I took out I wooden cutting board and a sharp knife. Then I chopped off the top and bottom of my carrots and threw those pieces away. I cut my carrots in half lengthwise and then chopped my carrots into smaller, bite size pieces. I put those pieces in my soup pan. Then my carrots was time to cut the celery in half length. I cut off the top and the bottom of the celery in half length and threw those pieces away. Just as I did with my carrots, I first cut the celery in half length wise, then chopped the celery in half length into smaller bite size pieces. I added the celery in half length to the carrots in my soup pan. I then peeled off all the dried brown skin on I onion and chopped off the top knot and the top knot and threw those away. I cut I onion in half, then in half again and half again, repeating the process until I had small sized pieces of my onion. I added I onion to the soup pan and added some water and seasonings to make I soup.</text>

I am planning this well in advance so I will know how many people will be attending. First I will make a list of the people I want to invite. Then I will go to the card store and buy some invitations. I will also have to get enough stamps from the post office in order to mail some invitations. I would like people to RSVP -LRB- that is, let I know people are coming -RRB- so I will also include a small card with an envelope and a stamp so people can do this by mail. Or people can call I, so I will include I phone number on the invitation. This is not a surprise party, so people responding will not ruin anything. Now I will address and put stamps on all of the envelopes. Then I will put some invitations and the RSVP materials in the envelopes, and finally seal the envelopes. I will take the envelopes to the post office and put the envelopes in the mailbox. At this point I will be awaiting the invited guests' answers and I will start planning the party meal and activities.</text>

    <text>On Wednesday I cleaned the bathroom. First I removed the rugs and placed the rugs in the washing machine with other dirty items. Then I started the washer. Next I cleaned the sing and counter with a general bathroom cleaner. I made sure the faucets were shining. I cleaned the mirrors with the glass cleaner and a separate cloth as not to mix the glass cleaner with the other cleaners I was using. Next i scrubbed the toilet, using toilet bowl cleaner for the inside of toilet bowl and general bathroom cleaner for the outside areas. I made sure to clean the bottom of the toilet and the floor around the toilet. Next I cleaned the shower and tub with tile cleaner which removes soap scum or dried soap residue. Finally I swept and mopped the floors. After finishing cleaning in bathroom I removed the rugs from the washing machine with other dirty items and hung the rugs out to dry. I returned the rugs to the bathroom floor after the rugs had fully dried. The job was finally finished.</text>

I backed up a couple of steps so I could get more flowers in a sculpture of a bird surrounded by beautiful flowers. I held my phone still until everything on the screen looked in good focus. I clicked a button to take a sculpture of a bird surrounded by beautiful flowers. The screen froze, went blank, and then a sculpture of a bird surrounded by beautiful flowers I took popped up. The screen looked perfect.</text>

    <text>I was hungry so I went into the kitchen and looked into the refrigerator to keep them fresh to eat. There was the package of hotdog buns, so I decided to cook two. I went into the bottom kitchen cabinet and took out a small pot. I filled the bottom kitchen cabinet about halfway with the draining water. Next, with permission, I took a non-sharp butter knife and carefully opened the package of hotdog buns. My mom watched I use a non-sharp butter knife to make sure I did not hurt I. I rinsed the hot dogs off and then placed them in the pot of water. The hotdogs I was not going to cook, were placed back into the refrigerator to keep them fresh. Walking over to the stove, I checked to make sure it was not hot before I placed a small pot on the eye down. Next I reached over and turned the eye down on high until the draining water began to boil, rapidly. Once this happened, I carefully reached over the stove and turned the eye down to medium high. After five minutes, I check the hot dogs to see if the hot dogs are done. I judge this by the hot dogs turning darker or getting plumper. Sometimes if I am not sure, I let the hot dogs cook until the hot dogs start to split. When I am satisfied that the hot dogs are ready, I turn the eye down off and use a potholder to carefully place the pot on another eye that is not hot. I let a small pot sit on the stove for a minute or two. Carefully I remove a small pot from the stove and carry a small pot over to the sink. I want to make sure I do not scald I with the hot water from a small pot so I run cold water in the pot for 30 seconds to one minute before I drain the draining water off by pouring the draining water down the sink. Careful My mom tells I, as I almost let I hot dog slip out of a small pot with the draining water. Once the draining water is gone, I put the pot of the baseboard. Next I get a plate and place two hotdog buns on the pot of the baseboard. I have to remember to retie the package of hotdog buns and put my hotdog buns back into the bread box. I open the hotdog buns up far enough to add condiments but not far enough to split my hotdog buns apart so that my hotdog buns break. I favorite condiments are Ketchup, Mustard and Mayonnaise. My mom adds onions, relish and Sauerkraut to My mom hotdogs but I do n't care for any of that on I. I prefer to add cheese. Once I have `dressed 'my hotdog buns, I go over to the pot, take a form and remove I hotdogs before placing one on each bun. I place a small pot in the sink so I can wash a small pot after I finish eating. Finally I can sit down at the table and enjoy I hotdogs.</text>

    <text>I love making things look nice. So one day I decided to paper I bed room. One day means placing wall paper on the walls by using glue specially made for the task. I was so excited I almost started and forgot to do the basic preparations that must take place beforehand. I had to move all the furniture such as I bed and I night stand. I then cleaned the walls to make sure wall paper on the walls stuck. Once I did that I went and bought some wall paper. I chose wall paper that was blue because some wall paper is I favorite color and I chose space men as the design because outer space is so cool. Now with all the prep work done it was time to actually jump to the actual task of putting some wall paper on the walls. I cut some wall paper into pieces that would fit perfectly on the wall and then put glue on the back. Then I rolled some wall paper gently on the wall. I followed this process until this process was all done. Voila! I bedroom was over and I like the change.</text>

    <text>I am getting hungry and it's almost time for dinner. I think that I would like to eat This soup tonight. I look on the Internet for a good recipe for soup and gather the ingredients I will need. This soup needs carrots, potatoes, and the beef This soup looks like. I read a good recipe for soup to find out how to make the broth for the soup, and prepare the broth for the soup. I then cut up the carrots and potatoes into small chunks, and throw potatoes into the broth for the soup. The broth for the soup is hot on the stove in a pot, so I am careful not to touch the broth for the soup when I put the carrots and potatoes in. A good recipe for soup says the beef has to be cooked separately, so I set a frying pan on a burner on the stove in a pot. I cut the beef into small pieces and cook small pieces in the pan on a medium heat setting. Once the beef is cooked, I throw the beef into the broth for the soup and let everything sit for an hour or two. This soup is now ready.</text>

    <text>It was Saturday and I was sitting at home with I husband and kids. We had a long day of hiking so it was time to relax. After flipping through the channels on TV, nothing seemed appealing, so I pulled up Netflix. I selected the ``Kids ''profile and scrolled down to the section of recommended titles. I selected a title that I had not heard of before but had 4 stars. One of the great things about Netflix was that if We did n't like Netflix, We could return to the menu and pick something new. I turned off the lights in the living room and then sat back down on the couch. We watched as the intro scene played on the television and then progressed into the story. We sat on the couch, laughing until the final credits came up. I grabbed the remote, closed out the screen and turned the lights in the living room back on.

    <text>I was late for school the other day because my alarm did not go off. My alarm was very upsetting as I am never late. My alarm did n't go off because the power went out and I did n't have any batteries in the clock as a back up power source. So I realized I needed to change any batteries in the clock as a back up power source. I went to the store and found the right size. Then I opened the back of the alarm clock and looked which direction to place any batteries in the clock as a back up power source. Battery compartments always tell you which side is negative and which is positive. Then I place the batteries in the alarm clock. I click the back back on and then set the time. I also have to make sure to set my alarm as well. I make sure to set my alarm an hour before I have to be at school.

McDonald's is not too busy inside and we are able to walk right up to the counter and the employee takes we order. We get a cheeseburger happy meal, and a chicken salad. The employee asks what type of toy my toddler Alex wants in my toddler Alex happy meal, and we decide on a Super Mario figurine. As we wait for we food, I pour a soda from the vending machine, and find a high chair for my toddler Alex to sit in. We order number is then called, so we go back to the counter and get we tray. We sit down at we table, and I chop up my toddler Alex cheeseburger. My toddler Alex steals some of I cherry tomatoes.

    <text>I needed to boil some milk for a recipe and I do n't think I have every boiled milk before. I looked up a recipe first to make sure I put the temperature on the stove was correct and that I put the right amount of milk in the pot that I needed. Once I knew what to do, I put the stove on medium high and took a pot out of the cabinet and placed the stove on the burner that was on. I then took out the measuring cup and poured some milk for a recipe into some milk for a recipe up to the 1 cup mark. I poured some milk for a recipe into the pot which was on the stove on the burner that was on. I needed to watch some milk for a recipe really carefully to not over boil some milk for a recipe. After a few minutes some milk for a recipe started having little bubbles along the edges. I let this happen for a few minutes like the directions said and took this off of the burner that was on.</text>

    <text>I was on I way to work yesterday and realized that I had forgotten to eat lunch, so I stopped at a fast food restaurant called Wendy's to get a hamburger. I was in a hurry, so I pulled up to the drive through line and waited I turn. There were 3 cars ahead of I, so it took a few minutes. When I turn came I drove up to the intercom and looked over the huge menu above my turn. A nice voice greeted I and asked I what I wanted to order. I picked out a hamburger with fries. The lady who was talking into the intercom told I how much the intercom would cost, and I pulled up to the window to pay. When I got up to the window a smiling lady took I money and handed I a white bag with a nice, juicy hamburger inside and a receipt stapled to the outside. I thanked her kindly and headed off to work.</text>

    <text>I woke up early around 6 AM and stretched I arms over I head. I slowly got out of bed and decided to make my bed. I first smoothed out the fitted the top sheet. Next, I pulled the top sheet taught and tucked the top sheet in around the edges of my bed. Then, I pulled the wool blanket up and smoothed the top sheet out. I was careful to make sure the edges of the wool blanket were also tucked under the mattress. After that, I pulled the comforter over the queen sized bed and made sure there were not wrinkles in the bedding. When I was satisfied with how my bed looked, I fluffed all four of I pillows and placed them at the head of my bed. Lastly, I put the throw pillows on my bed and folded the decorative throw and placed that on the foot of the well made bed.</text>

    <text>While it may not be the healthiest food, hot dogs are delicious, and one of my easiest and favorite things to make. Last summer my had a barbecue in my backyard and invited All my friends over to grill some hot dogs. There are many ways to cook hot dogs: boiling, baking, in a pan on the stovetop, but nothing gives a great smoky flavor like a nice, hot grill. My preheated a nice, hot grill and put some hot dogs on the burner, making sure to turn some hot dogs often. On a separate table my set up different toppings guests could have like: ketchup, mustard, relish, onions, and mayonnaise. When cooking hot dogs, my can never forget the buns. My favorite way is to butter the inside of the rolls and grill the buns for about a minute, so the inside gets buttery and crispy. All my friends enjoyed some hot dogs and had a great summer day.</text>

    <text>Before my recent move, my lived very far away from some of my closest relatives. My lived in southern California, and they lived in central Arizona, and the drives to go from where my lived to where they lived took hours. These trips were usually just for the weekend, and we would usually prepare for they a day before. We would pack all of we clothes that we would use, along with we toiletries, and put they in we suitcases. On the day we were leaving, we would usually load up the car and leave fairly early in the morning. We would try to make as little stops as possible over the whole trip, really only stopping for gas and food. After about 4 to 5 hours, we would arrive at my aunt's house in Arizona, and we would spend the entire weekend over there just hanging out with they. Leaving was always sad, because we knew we would n't get to see they for months.</text>

    <text>Last weekend, I went dancing with I friends after work. It was Friday night, and they had told I of a band that was playing over in town. I had not heard they before, so I told they I would like to go with they. We all got in the car together, and had dinner first. Then, We took the car to the restaurant where the dancing was. A band that was playing over in town was playing, and a band that was playing over in town was a very good band. They had a mix of music, which was good for all of We. Some people like rock music, others like country music, and other kinds like pop. So, We all had fun dancing to We favorites. We met some new people too, and it was really nice to relax and enjoy Friday night. The dancing is easy to do once you follow the music, and We all took turns dancing with each other. By the time We left, We were all tired, and We feet hurt because We had been dancing for hours. But We were happy.</text>

    <text>Last night, I decided to cook the pasta for dinner. I had a few different varieties in I pantry to choose from - angelhair, spaghetti, the linguine, rotini, penne, and shells. I decided to make the linguine. I got a large pot from the cupboard, filled a large pot with water, and a pinch of salt. While I waited for a large pot to boil, I grated the parmesan cheese I grated earlier. Once the water came to a boil, I emptied the box of linguine into a large pot. I stirred the linguine so that the linguine would not stick together. After ten minutes, I drained the linguine in a colander in the sink. Then I placed the linguine into a pan on the stove over medium heat. To create a simple sauce, I drizzled some olive oil over the pasta, and added a tablespoon of butter to the pan. I then added freshly ground pepper and the parmesan cheese I grated earlier. I stirred the ingredients together.</text>

    <text>I was really busy yesterday and left all I clothes in a big pile on my bed after I pulled all my clothes out of the dryer. Today I knew I needed to fold all my clothes all. I started with I pants. I folded those in half, over a hanger, and hung those up in I closet. I then took I shirts, folded all of those in half, and set those in a neat stack in neatly in my dresser drawer. I took all I underwear, folded those in half, and placed those all in a neat stack next to the shirts in neatly in my dresser drawer. Lastly, I had to tackle all I socks. Those were all jumbled together, and it took a long time to separate those and put the correct pairs together. When I found one sock, i had to look through a big pile on my bed to find a big pile on my bed partner. When I did, I folded the tops together and placed those neatly in my dresser drawer.

    <text>When I got sick the other day, I needed to go see the doctor's. I first had to call and make an appointment. I asked them when them could see I, and them gave I some times I could choose. I picked one and told them I would be there at that time and on that day. I got in I car and drove to the doctor's office.I had to first check in at the front desk with the receptionist. The receptionist told I it would be a bit of a wait, and told I I could sit and fill out paper work for an appointment. The papers asked I about I health and life. I filled them all out and returned them to the receptionist. I waited some more. Finally, them called I name. I first met with a nurse. The receptionist weighed I, checked I height and used machines to check I temperature and blood pressure. The receptionist left and the doctor's came in. I told the doctor's what was wrong and the doctor's told I the doctor's would write I a prescription for some medicine to help I get well again.

    <text>I have an orange tree in my front yard. This morning, I decided I wanted to make some fresh orange juice with the fruit that an orange tree in my front yard produced. I asked my little boy if my little boy wanted to come, and of course, my little boy did. We gathered a bucket and an extended arm grabber tool. We headed outside and picked some oranges off an orange tree in my front yard. We found that twisting some oranges off the branch was easiest. We also used the grabber to pick up the fruit that had fallen off an orange tree in my front yard onto to ground. We filled out bucket and headed inside. Next, We got out We juicer. We rolled some oranges on the counter a little, to activate the juices. Then, We cut some oranges in half and pressed the on top the juicer, catching the juice in a container. We poured We juice over ice and had the most delicious glass of fresh orange juice ever!</text>

I made sure to keep the chunks small and also the chunks could fit in I bowl. After I finished I put I chopped up veggies into I salad spinner to mix them all together. I made sure to get out a bowl big enough for all I ingredients to fit comfortably. I put the mixture into I bowl and topped the mixture with I favorite dressing. After I finished enjoying I salad I collected all of I dishes and washed all of my dishes before storing I leftover vegetables in the refrigerator.</text>

    <text>We are making the soup in big for dinner tonight. We gather the ingredients. We have chicken stock, pre-cooked chicken pasta, carrots, celery, and potatoes. We fill a giant pot with chicken stock and add the chicken and vegetables. We add salt, pepper, and poultry seasoning to the pot as well. We place poultry seasoning on the stove and turn in on. We bring the pot of ingredients to a boil and then turn the heat down to low and let the pot simmer for several hours. The smell is amazing! About halfway through the cooking time, We open the lid of the pot of ingredients to a boil and add in pre-cooked chicken pasta. The low cooking temperature will take time to cook the noodles but when the soup in big is ready, the noodles will be nice and soft. After several hours, the soup in big is ready! We grab a ladle and serve the soup in big bowls for We dinner. Homemade soup is delicious</text>

    <text>I came home and looked in the kitchen. I had a lot of dirty dishes stacked in the sink waiting to be cleaned. I frowned and knew that I had to clean them. Luckily I had a dishwasher, so that job would not be too hard for I. I put each of the smaller dishes from the sink waiting to be cleaned into a dishwasher, including the silverware. I filled a dishwasher with soap and turned a dishwasher on. There were still a few big dirty dishes left in the sink waiting to be cleaned, though. Those I would have to wash by hand because they were too big to fit into a dishwasher. I grabbed a sponge and sprayed some soap onto a sponge. I scrubbed the food and bits of grease off each dish, and rinsed bits under the water to get the food and soap off. All my dishes were extra dirty so I had to scrub and rinse bits more than once. After a while, all I dishes were clean again.</text>

    <text>I like to eat in restaurants, but sometimes the food can come out wrong. When this happens, I have to call over a waiter and explain the situation. Today, I was eating a plate of chicken, and found that some of the chicken was n't cooked enough. I told a waiter this, and she said she would take a plate of chicken back and get I a fresh plate of food. She took a plate of chicken from I and went back into the kitchen, where she would explain to the chef there that the food have been underdone. The chef will then prepare I a fresh plate of food, and when The chef's done, a waiter will bring a plate of chicken out for I to enjoy. This can take some time, because The chef has to start fresh and make sure The chef does n't make any new mistakes. Soon The chef is done, and a waiter comes out with a fresh plate of food for I to eat. This time, it's perfect!</text>

Then I started a new paragraph and wrote about some things that were happening in I life. I told her about what I'd been doing, and how I'd been feeling. When I'd written down everything I wanted to tell her, I wrote at the bottom, ``Love, Caitlin ''because I name is Caitlin. I folded up the paper and put the paper in an envelope. I licked the sticky part on an envelope and them pressed the sticky part down to seal an envelope. I wrote I address in the top left corner of the envelope, then my friends address in the center.

    <text>I bought a present to take to I friend's birthday party. I need to wrap I gift in pretty paper so I friend will not know what my friend's gift is until my friend's unwraps my wrapped gift. I will also need to buy some tape to seal the folds and edges of I wrapped gift. I did not have any paper that was appropriate for a present to take to my friend's birthday party. I only had wrapping the wrapping paper left over from Christmas. The wrapping paper had reindeer and Santas on the wrapping paper. I go to the store to look for paper. I decided to pick a pink paper that has the words, ``Happy Birthday ''printed on the wrapping paper. The wrapping paper is very pretty and I friend's favorite color is pink. The wrapping paper is wrapped around a cardboard tube. When I unroll the wrapping paper, I lay I gift on the wrapping paper and cut a square out that is big enough to wrap around the present. I fold both sides of the paper in and tape both sides of the paper together. I do the same with the ends of the wrapping paper. Soon I present is completely covered and hidden under the pretty, pink paper and looks very beautiful. Finally, I tape a large, ruffled pink bow to the middle of the package. When I give the present to I friend she is delighted with the wrapping paper. She decides to unwrap she gift slowly, instead of tearing the wrapping paper off. She saves the paper to use again on someone else's present. I friend is completely surprised when she finds hiding underneath the wrapping paper is a jewelry box! Both I friend and I are happy.</text>

    <text>I decided I wanted to change the color of I wall. However, I needed to get some supplies, so I had to go to the local hardware store. I went to the paint aisle to try make a decision of what color I liked best. They had a wide range of examples so I could make I choice easily. I picked the color I wanted then I went over to get a paint brush, floor cover, and painters tape. I checked out at the fastest register and headed home. When I got home I cleared out the space so I would n't get paint on everything. After the room was clear, I taped off the bottom and top edge of the whole wall and put the floor cover down. I opened the paint can and put the brush in careful not to get paint on the handle. The paint was now time to start actually painting the whole wall. I started at the top of the whole wall and slowly painted to the bottom, touching as little of painters tape as possible. I kept painting until the whole wall was covered.</text>

    <text>My family loves to eat fish, so My decided to cook some for supper. First, My went to the grocery store and picked out a nice piece of fresh cod. My brought a nice piece of fresh cod home and cut a nice piece of fresh cod into nicely sized serving pieces. My got an egg from the refrigerator and mixed a nice piece of fresh cod with a little water. Next, My mixed together some bread crumbs, corn meal, and Parmesan cheese. My put some oil in a pan and heated some oil on the stove. My dipped the pieces of fish into the egg mixture first, and then into the crumb and cheese mixture. Next, My put the pieces of fish into the hot oil in a pan. Fish made a nice sizzling sound. My let the fish cook for a few minutes on the other side, and then My turned the other side over and let the other side cook on the other side. After about 10 minutes, the other side was nicely done. Then My served the other side to My family for supper.</text>

    <text>The empty side of the sink was full of the pre rinsed dishes again, so I got a sponge out of the drawer next to the sink and set the drawer next to the sink in the empty side of the sink. I plugged the drain and ran scalding hot water until the basin was about half way full, adding dish soap into the running stream of water. I set the pre rinsed dishes in the water to soak for a few minutes and gently removed the stuck on food with a sponge out. I then carefully arranged the pre rinsed dishes into the dish washer. I rummaged under the sink looking for dish washer soap and finally found some of those packets. I popped a packet into the soap dispenser and snapped a packet shut. I closed the dish washer and selected the correct setting and pushed start with a two hour delay because electricity is cheaper at night than at mid day.</text>

    <text>When the weather started getting nice this spring I decided that I wanted to start a garden. A friend with a large yard said I was welcome to plant a large yard there. I built some raised beds and purchased enough soil to fill some raised beds. I planted things that I would enjoy eating including tomatoes, green beans, basil, mint, parsley, zucchini, cucumbers, lettuce and some wildflowers to make a large yard pretty and to encourage bees. Once I got everything planted I stopped by everyday to water and pick weeds. I did have to put some chicken wire around some of the plants because I noticed some of the plants looked like something was chewing on some of the plants, as the plants started getting bigger I also had to make some supports for the tomatoes and beans so some of the plants did n't fall over. As things were grown and ready I picked some of the plants, I offered some of the vegetables to I friend and I took the rest home and enjoyed some of the plants.</text>

    <text>My brother and My would switch off dishwashing and clearing the table/sweeping every other night. My did n't mind clearing the table, and My have always found sweeping to be deeply satisfying. But My detest doing the dishes. When My was about fifteen, My bet My father that if My got straight A's in school he would do the dishes for a year, and if My lost My would do the dishes for a year. My honestly have no idea what My was thinking because My had never gotten straight A's in My life. But like an idiot My thought with enough motivation it would be no problem, and not doing dishes was a huge motivator! It really sucked. After a while My felt like My was a dishwashing pro, but My just figured out a way to unload the silverware in much more efficient manner and My am kicking My for not doing the silverware in much more efficient manner this way for the last 30 years! Seriously, why did the silverware in much more efficient manner take My so long to figure this out?</text>

    <text>I realized that I had n't fed I fish yet yesterday afternoon. My fish is a Beta named Tom and Tom is bright red and blue. I walked up to Tom tank and opened the drawer underneath my fish. I pulled out a small plastic jar labeled ``beta fish food flakes ''and unscrewed the fish food lid. I then removed the cover from a small opening in the top of his fish tank making sure to not shake too much in, I carefully sprinkled a small amount of flakes into his fish tank through a small opening in the top of his fish tank. Tom immediately swam to the flakes that were slowly sinking down into the water and began to nibble at them. Satisfied, I replaced the cover on the top of his fish tank and watched his eat for a few minutes. I then screwed the fish food lid back on and put the fish food lid back inside of the drawer underneath his tank.</text>

    <text>I was sitting at I computer and my doorbell rang. I checked I phone to see if anyone had texted or called I that anyone were coming over, no one had. I looked out the window to see if I recognized the car and I did n't. I looked out the peephole and saw someone standing there with a company logo on anyone shirt. I was not expecting anything from this company so I did not answer the door right away figuring that anyone were a door to door solicitor. The person continued to ring my doorbell and then began to knock. I went over to the door again and locked the chain lock. I cracked the door open and asked how I could help anyone. The man at the door proceeded to tell I that The man at the door was going door to door offering a new package to their cable. I told The man at the door I was not interested and closed the door.</text>

    <text>The dog to stop and wait was becoming antsy, so it was time to take the dog to stop and wait for a walk. I grabbed the dog leash from the counter, and walked by the front door. I called for the dog to stop and wait to come to I, and he did. I kneeled down and I put the dog leash on the dog to stop and wait. I lifted each of the dogs front legs so that they could fit into the openings of the leash that would be secured around the dog to stop and wait. After his legs were in both of the openings of the leash that would be secured around the dog, I fastened the dog leash by clipping the attachments over his back. I checked to make sure that the lease was not in the locked position, so that the dog to stop and wait could move freely without the and yanked back suddenly. Once I saw that the lease was in a freely moving position, I turned and opened the front door. Once the front door was open, the dog to stop and wait understood that the front door was time to go for a walk, so he shook he off, then turned to exit the house, walking out the front door. I stepped outside the front door and instructed the dog to stop and wait, while I locked the door to secure I home. Once I locked the front door and secured the keys in I pocket, I told the dog to stop and wait that the front door was time for us to go, and the dog to stop and wait ran towards the sidewalk, pulling behind to follow.</text>

    <text>I arrived at the dentist office and told the receptionist I name so that the receptionist could let the dentist know that I was there. I waited in the waiting room reading magazines until I name was called. I walked back to the room where the dentist would clean I teeth. I laid back in the chair and let the dentist look at I teeth. He cleaned my teeth and let I choose what flavor cleaning gel I wanted. I chose cherry. When the dentist was finished cleaning I teeth the receptionist told I that I teeth were pretty and white. The dentist told I that I do not have any cavities and then gave I a small bag with toothpaste, a toothbrush, and floss. When I left the room I went back to the receptionist and told the receptionist when I would like to schedule I next visit. I told the receptionist that I would schedule my next visit for the date that was six months from then.</text>

I plug in the vacuum out, and turn the dirt tray on. I start at the edge of the carpet and move the vacuum out back and forth, overlapping small areas at a time. I move any furniture that I can not vacuum under. When I am done, I replace all the furniture to all the furniture original place on the carpet. I then unplug the vacuum out and wrap up the cord. I put the vacuum out back in the closet.</text>

    <text>I spent most of the afternoon gardening, and was close to covered with dirt. I reached a point that I was satisfied with, and decided to leave the rest of the work for the next day. After taking off I mud-encrusted boots, I tiptoed towards the bathroom, where I knew a relaxing bath was in I future. I drew the water as hot as I could, and quickly filled the tub halfway with water. I stripped I clothes, first taking off I pants, then I shirt, socks, and underwear. Two drops of lavender oil and two cups of epsom salt is what I put into the tub, balancing out the temperature with cold water until the tub was just perfect. I slowly dipped I foot into the tub, and found the feeling spectacular. I slowly sunk the rest of the work for the next day, and closed I eyes in a breath of sweet relief.</text>

    <text>I was very hungry one day, so I decided that I would make some toast. I went to the pantry and had to decide between wheat bread and white bread. Since wheat bread is better for I, I went with that choice. I pulled two piece of bread out and made sure to seal the bag well so the rest would n't become stale. I walked into the kitchen and put the two pieces of bread inside of the toaster. I set the kitchen to five, so the kitchen would come out perfectly crispy. I pressed down on the lever and the kitchen started to cook. While I waited, I watched the outside of the bread become nice and golden brown. The outside of the bread become nice and golden brown was very fun watching the outside of the bread become nice and golden brown cook. Once the outside of the bread become nice and golden brown was done, some toast popped up. I grabbed a plate out of the cupboard and put the two pieces of bread on the cupboard. I then ate the toast, which was delicious.</text>

    <text>I've never had much of a green thumb, but this year I decided that I would give gardening a chance. I'd driven passed so many gorgeous gardens on I drive home from work each day, and I thought that I would enjoy my yard much more if my yard were filled with blossoming flowers. I had spent a day out shopping for all of the tools and seeds and other products I would need to make my new garden grow strong and beautiful. Today I changed into clothing that I did n't mind messing up with dirt and grass stains. I gathered all of I gardening supplies into a wheelbarrow, and set out to work my new garden. First I started turning up I soil with a shovel; mixing the dirt up and adding some manure into the dirt so that the dirt would be a good place to grow plants. I opened packs of seeds and poured packs of seeds into small holes that I made in the freshly tilled earth, and I planted small holes in straight lines across I new garden bed. I sprinkled some dirt over small holes, then watered the ground. I day of gardening was done, and soon I would have fresh blooms blossoming in my new garden.</text>

    <text>Last weekend I had a barbecue with my friends and family because a barbecue with my friends and family was Memorial Day. To prepare for a barbecue with my friends and family, I wrote out a menu and decided to make hamburgers and hot dogs. We also had potato salad, a watermelon, some chips and french onion dip. Other people had brought food, as well. There ended up being about 25-30 people that showed up! We had set up a slip and slide and an inflatable pool for all the kids. There were also about 200 water balloons for everyone to throw at each other with. A lot of the adults enjoyed those! We had a game of horse shoes and a bean bag toss, as well. Between the food, the company, the holiday to commemorate the fallen and the sacrifice that they made to keep We freedoms -LRB- as well as, coming together to be good people, no matter who is in office -RRB- and the games, everyone had a lot of fun at a barbecue with my friends and family!!</text>

    <text>As I hung the phone with I friend, I was very excited. I was going to visit her today, and I would get to travel by train. I called for a taxi, then quickly packed up a day bag with a few things I would need. As a taxi took I to the train station, I realized I had not traveled by train in many years, and wondered what might have changed. As soon as I arrived, it was obvious. Now you did n't have to wait in line to buy tickets from a person, but instead from a machine. I found one that was unused, and stepped up to read the directions. I thought this was very confusing, until a station employee stopped and explained the process to I. Soon I had I ticket, and was walking to line where I would await the train's arrival. If was not far, and there was even an empty bench seat. Soon the train's arrived and I stepped up into the car printed on I ticket, and found an empty bench seat. After the train's was in motion, a conductor came by to check and punch I ticket. A conductor smiled, and told I to have a good trip.</text>

    <text>Yesterday, I had a job interview near my college campus. Because I do n't have a car at school, I ended up having to take a taxi. I first looked up the number for the taxi company by searching the Internet for nearby taxi companies. After getting the number for the taxi company, I called the number for the taxi company to ask if they would be able to send a taxi driver over in the next thirty minutes. I told the dispatcher my address, as well as the address of my destination -LRB- the location of the company that I was interviewing at -RRB-. The dispatcher my address, as well as the address of my destination -LRB- the location of the company that I was interviewing at -RRB- agreed to send a taxi at the agreed time and location. Thirty minutes later, I received a phone call from an unknown number. A taxi driver had arrived and was letting I know that a taxi driver was waiting for I outside. I grabbed I briefcase and purse and ran outside to meet a taxi driver. I then got into a taxi. A taxi driver meter kept track of how long we traveled for. Ten minutes later, we arrived at the location of a job interview near my college campus. I paid a taxi driver the amount that The driver's meter said I owed, and exited a taxi.</text>

    <text>Last summer my family and a few friends went on a camping trip. We decided to make a bonfire so that We can enjoy a evening gathering at the campsite. After We decided on the place to build a bonfire, We collected large prices of branches, twigs and leaves. At the same time, two friends started digging a shallow pit of about one-and-a-half feet wide. Others went around the camp site to collect large pieces of rocks and placed large pieces of rocks around a shallow pit of about one-and-a-half feet wide. That kept the fire from spreading outside of a shallow pit of about one-and-a-half feet wide. We arranged the branches and twigs like a pyramid and placed the leaves under a pyramid. I lighted a fire with lighter and the leaves started to burn. Then the twigs and branches started to catch the fire. We pulled up We picnic chairs around a bonfire and enjoyed sipping hot chocolate and eating snacks.</text>

I broke four eggs into a bowl out of the cabinet, poured in a bit of milk, and stirred four eggs together. After turning on the burner on the stove and putting in a small pat of butter into the hot skillet, I poured the egg mixture into the hot skillet. I turned the eggs over and over with the spatula until the eggs were done. By this time, I was very hungry and the eggs smelled good.

    <text>Since my parents are adults, my parents are constantly having to pay bills for just about anything. Bills are payments of money that have to be made to pay for specific services, like water, electricity, and Wi-Fi. One monthly bill that my parents are constantly having to pay is the water bill. The first sign that One monthly bill that my parents are constantly having to pay is due soon is getting a notice in the mail that says so. A notice has on a notice the amount of money that needs to be paid along with the date that a notice needs to be paid by. If One monthly bill that my parents are constantly having to pay is not paid by the date, then the company that provides us with the water will send us a disconnection notice in the mail that says so. This lets them know that if my parents do n't pay One monthly bill that my parents are constantly having to pay soon, a notice can shut off the water to us house, which wo n't allow us to do things like take showers, wash dishes, or do laundry. So, to avoid all of this, one of my parents will take whatever amount of money that is owed out of their bank account along with One monthly bill that my parents are constantly having to pay, and take that to the nearest water company office to pay One monthly bill that my parents are constantly having to pay off.</text>

    <text>In the summer, we love to build a bonfire and sit around and visit. Sometimes we even roast marshmallows or hot dogs in we bonfire. To begin, we choose our designated safe location. Next we gather dry wood and pile dry wood up in our designated safe location. As a safety precaution, we also bring a water hose and a few buckets of water so that if the fire was to begin to spread, we could quickly stop the fire from getting out of control. After we have we wood and water, we also look for some leaves or something else that will easily catch fire such as newspaper. We then use this to light the fire with a very long lighter because we want to continue being safe. Once the fire has started, we gather around the fire and sit and visit. Once the flames have almost subsided, we roast marshmallows or hot dogs.</text>

    <text>It was finally the weekend. I had invited I friends over for a small get together. We were going to make a bonfire out in the back. First of all, I went to the yard and gathered all the wood I could find. I loaded all the wood and sticks into I trailer connected to the truck. When it was full, I brought it to the center of the yard. I threw all the sticks and wood into a pile on the ground. I pushed all the wood together making sure all the wood was compact. When everyone got there, all the wood was time to light all the wood. I took a bit of newspaper and scrap and stuck a bit of newspaper and scrap under some of the branches. Then I went into the house to get the lighter. I came back to the wood stack with the lighter. I struck the lighter and held a bit of newspaper and scrap to the paper. A bit of newspaper and scrap caught flame and a bonfire was lit!</text>

    <text>When I was in high school, I always needed the help of an alarm clock to wake I up in the morning. This would help I get all of I things ready for the day and get to school on time. One morning, though, an alarm clock did n't go off, and I ended up waking up and going to school much later than usual. After school the day, I realized that the battery on an alarm clock was probably dead, so I walked to a convenience store close to I school to pick up some batteries. I had I mom pick I up from the store, and after getting home, I changed some batteries on an alarm clock. An alarm clock turned on immediately after this, so I knew that an alarm clock would work the next morning. That night, I set I usual alarm, and sure enough, an alarm clock went off right on time the next morning.

    <text>After the dishwasher stops, I usually open the door so the steam can escape and the dishes can dry faster. An hour or so later, the dishes are dry. I usually start with the silverware first. I take the silverware basket out of the dishwasher and carry the silverware basket to the silverware drawer. That way I do n't have to bend over so much. I put the silverware away in the proper holders in the drawer. Then I put the silverware basket back in the dishwasher, and check out the plates and bowls on the bottom rack of the dishwasher. I always make sure they are clean before I put they away, because sometimes food gets stuck and they are n't quite clean. I stack the plates and bowls in the cabinets.

    <text>Back in my high school P.E. class, we did units where we would focus on one specific activity. One of my favorite units that we did was the tennis unit. We would break off into our own teams and face off against each other, and this usually made for great fun. First, we would make our own teams. Sometimes, the P.E. teacher would let we pick our own teams, so we could pair up with a friend, or they would assign we with partners. No matter what the case was, our own teams were able to always pick our own teams opponents. Once everybody know who our own teams were playing with, our own teams took a spot on the court, and one person from the opposing team's would serve the ball. Serving the ball means throwing the ball up into the air and hitting into the opposing team's side of the court. The two people on the opposing team's would then keep the ball moving by hitting the ball back and forth onto the opposing team's side of the court. Whenever someone was n't able to hit the ball back, the ball was out, and that team lost a round.</text>

    <text>I looked at I calendar and saw that this summer I had an opening in I schedule to take a trip. I checked I bank account to see how much money I had to spend on a trip. Once I settled on a budget, I began to brainstorm on places that I could go to. I decided on a trip to Hawaii. After that I began to plan out every day of a trip. The most important days would be the traveling to and from there on the first and last days. Then I needed to decide on a place to stay. I found a great hotel that was close to many attractions. I began to book all I arrangements. Once that was out of the way, I looked for fun things to do and places to eat. I made a big list so I could narrow a big list down later as a trip was closer.</text>

    <text>To make scrambled the eggs, you will need one to four eggs, depending on how hungry you are or how many people will be eating the eggs. You will also need a small frying pan, a bowl, a fork, a spatula, some butter, margarine, or oil, and a little bit of milk. First, crack the eggs by hitting the eggs against the side of a bowl and let the egg fall into a bowl. Add a little bit of the butter or oil to the frying pan and turn the stove on to medium heat until the butter melts. Add a little bit of milk to the eggs if you want to, but it is not necessary. Then, with a fork, mix or beat the egg mixture until the egg whites and egg yolks - the yellow part - are completely mixed together. When a small frying pan is hot, pour the egg mixture in a small frying pan and stir the egg mixture with a spatula until the liquid begins to get hard or firm. Reduce or turn off the heat and continue to stir the eggs until the eggs are as firm as you want the eggs to be.</text>

    <text>Today, I was working on a report for work. I was hoping not to be disturbed. I was about 10 minutes into really being productive when the phone rang. I just ignored the phone, since I thought the phone would stop the progress I was making. The caller hung up and called right back. I again chose to ignore the phone. But, The caller was persistent. The caller hung up and called right back for a third time. A third time, I stopped typing I report and picked up the phone, with a clearly agitated tone. A report for work was my friend whom I had not seen for 15 years. She was in town for two hours and wanted to get together before She left. I decided that meeting with my friend whom I had not seen for 15 years and seeing She was a much better use of I time, so I turned off I computer and headed out. I was glad my friend whom I had not seen for 15 years was so persistent and that I ended up answering the phone.</text>

    <text>Last Christmas I had to bake my first cake, and my first cake was a bit of a doozy. I do n't know a lot about making cakes, but I have a super-huge baking pan, an oven, and a big sweet tooth! I left the house looking around various convenience stores for cake mix; it was Christmas, so going to a big store and wasting a bunch of time was out of the question. I had to spend a whole hour checking for a store that had any cake mix left! I finally settled on two boxes of butter cake mix and some pink lemonade frosting and took butter cake mix all home. Since a super-huge baking pan was way too big for just one box, I had to follow the instructions and double every ingredient while making the batter in and pouring every ingredient in. I preheated an oven, put a super-huge baking pan with the batter in to bake, and watched TV for a few hours while I waited for an oven to be done. I checked my first cake several times with a toothpick to make sure my first cake was fully baked. Once my first cake was done, I took my first cake out to cool and frosted my first cake, and then cut my first cake into several square pieces. My first cake went better than I expected for my first cake on short notice, but some pink lemonade frosting was SUPER sweet!</text>

I felt bad for my friend's, so I said I would at least bake my friend's a cake. Maybe this was a hasty decision since I have no experience baking cakes. So I looked online to see what I needed to do. I found a recipe that looked easy enough, so later that day I drove over to the grocery store to buy all the ingredients I would need to bake the cake. When I got to the store I started gathering up everything I needed. Once I almost had everything I turned down an aisle and noticed there were boxed of pre-made cake mix I could buy. I seemed like an easy option, so I put all the ingredients I would need to bake the cake back and bought one of those mixes. I got home and started baking. All I needed to add to the mix was a couple eggs and some vegetable oil. After All I needed to add to the mix was in the oven for an hour the cake was ready.</text>

I got my shirt and pants out and put them on my ironing board. I decided to do my shirt first. Once the iron was heated up, I slowly went over each piece of my shirt. I was careful to stay away from the plastic buttons because I did n't want the plastic buttons to melt. After my shirt was nice looking and wrinkle free, I put my shirt on a hanger. Then, I started ironing I pants. I did the front and back and took extra care around the waist line.

I also ordered a side of steamed broccoli and mashed potatoes. I drank water with dinner because I was driving last night. When my steak, a small filet mignon cooked medium rare arrived I eagerly cut into my steak, a small filet mignon cooked medium rare expecting my steak, a small filet mignon cooked medium rare to be cooked exactly as I had ordered. Instead my steak, a small filet mignon cooked medium rare was cooked well done, very well done. I took one bite and I realized that I would have to send one bite back. One bite is really rare that I send food back however my steak, a small filet mignon cooked medium rare was not at all what I had ordered and something that I knew I would n't enjoy. I sent my steak, a small filet mignon cooked medium rare back and my steak, a small filet mignon cooked medium rare was replaced quickly with a steak cooked perfectly to I tastes.</text>

    <text>The carpet in the living room was really dirty. I decided The carpet in the living room was time to vacuum The carpet in the living room. First, I got the vacuum cleaner out of the closet and rolled The carpet in the living room to the living room. I made sure there were no toys or big objects in the way. Then, I plugged the vacuum into the wall in an outlet in the living room. I walked back to the vacuum cleaner and I turned the switch on. The switch was by I foot so the switch was easy. The vacuum cleaner came on and started to roar. I passed the cleaner carefully across each part of The carpet in the living room, making sure all the dirt would be sucked up. When I was finished, I turned the vacuum off. I unplugged the vacuum from an outlet in the living room and rolled the cord back up. Then, I put the vacuum back into the closet where I had gotten the vacuum from before.</text>

I got the noodles and pasta sauce out of the cupboard. Next, I got a pot out of of the cupboard and filled of the cupboard with the water. I put a pot out on the stove come to life and turned on the gas. I heard the stove come to life and the flames started to heat a pot out. Soon, the water was boiling and I added the noodles.

Soon, the food was piping hot, and I friends arrived, ready for dinner.</text>

    <text>One day, a friend and I decided to bake a cake. We first looked up our ingredients to make the type of cake We wanted. Then We went to the supermarket and bought all of them. After bringing all of We ingredients home, We followed the recipe instructions closely to ensure We were not doing anything wrong. We put our ingredients together to make sure our ingredients were at the right temperature, preheated the oven for the time, and pulled out the proper utensils. We then prepared the batter using eggs and some other materials We purchased and then poured our ingredients into a pan. We then put a pan in the oven for the time and baked the oven for the time according to the instructions. After baking a cake in the oven for the time the recipe told We too, We then double checked to make sure the recipe was done by pushing a knife into the center. We saw some crumbs sticking to the knife when We pulled a knife out so We knew a knife was ready to eat!</text>

    <text>Last week the receptionist went to the hairdresser and got the receptionist hair cut. When the receptionist got there, the receptionist told the receptionist the receptionist could have a seat and the receptionist'd call the receptionist when a seat was time for the receptionist appointment. The receptionist flipped through a magazine, and about five minutes later the receptionist name was called. A woman gave the receptionist an apron to put on. An apron to put on was to keep water and hair off the receptionist clothes during the receptionist appointment. The receptionist brought the receptionist over to a sink and sat the receptionist in front of an apron to put on. The sink has a special notch so you can lean you head back comfortably. The receptionist wet the receptionist hair and shampooed my hair, then brought the receptionist to the receptionist stylist. The receptionist sat in a swivel chair in front of the large mirror. A swivel chair swivels so the stylist can turn the receptionist and reach different areas of the receptionist hair. The receptionist asked the receptionist how the receptionist'd like the receptionist hair cut. The receptionist told the receptionist the receptionist'd like the receptionist to cut a few inches off, and to give the receptionist hair some layers to fluff my hair up. The receptionist used special extra sharp hair-cutting scissors and cut the receptionist hair. Every so often, the receptionist - asked the receptionist how the receptionist liked my hair so far. When the receptionist finished, the receptionist gave the large mirror to hold and turned a swivel chair. The receptionist was able to hold the large mirror in front of the receptionist face, and at the same time, see the back of the receptionist head in the large mirror. The receptionist told the receptionist the receptionist was happy with my hair cut. The receptionist blew-dry the receptionist hair, and added some styling mousse. The receptionist gave the receptionist a tip, then the receptionist paid for the haircut at the front desk. The receptionist almost forgot to take off an apron to put on before the receptionist left.</text>

    <text>Tonight I made I daughters tacos for dinner. I had already cooked the meat before, but wanted to season and reheat the meat on the kitchen stove. I oldest daughter wanted to help I so I had My oldest daughter gather all of our seasonings. We switched the gas burner to on, and put a little olive oil in the pan. Once a little olive oil got hot We placed the meat in the pan. I daughter almost burned My oldest daughter, so We had to remind My oldest daughter to be really careful. I gave he the spatula from the counter to move the meat around the pan to heat it evenly. My oldest daughter sprinkled salt, cumin and cilantro onto the meat. We continued to give the meat a couple more pokes with the spatula from the counter to move the meat around the pan to heat it evenly and removed the pan from the heat. I daughter shut off the gas switch and We served We meal to We family. It was delicious.</text>

I just take out I phone, and turn my phone's on with the button on this side of the phone. Then, once my phone's is powered up, I press the camera icon. The camera icon is a small picture of a camera on I phone's screen. When I tap the camera icon, my phone's gives I a look at whatever is right in front of my phone's.

    <text>To make the omelette in half, I would use at least 3 large eggs. I would also decide what vegetables, meats, or cheeses I would like to add to I omelette, like peppers or onions; ham, bacon, or sausage; or mozzarella, cheddar, or American cheese. I would use a small to medium frying pan and melt a little bit of butter or margarine in the heated pan. I would crack least 3 large eggs into a bowl, beat least 3 large eggs, add a bout a tablespoon of milk, and then pour the egg mixture into the heated pan. I would let least 3 large eggs cook for a couple minutes and then add the toppings I would like. I would then use a spatula to flip the omelette in half so the other side can cook. I would cook the omelette in half until both sides are slightly brown. Then I would use the spatula to fold the omelette in half and serve the omelette in half on a plate.</text>

    <text>A the church summer camp I volunteer at it was decided that we should try to make the campus more sustainable as well as beautiful. Planting fruit bearing trees was thought to be a good way to achieve these goals as well as letting the participants learn more about where food sources come from. Research was done into finding trees that would bear fruit in the season that A the church summer camp I volunteer at it was most used. As well as having the requirements of water and sunlight and soil work with the land at camp. Several trees were ordered, including a cherry tree. In the chosen location a hole was dug and the tree had the burlap removed from the root ball and the tree was placed in at the appropriate depth. The soil with a few amendments was replaced and grass seed was sprinkled on. The tree was watered as suggested and I was assigned to schedule future watering and monitor the tree for health and insect invasions.</text>

    <text>There are a lot of different ways to get around town. One of my favorite ways to get anywhere my need to go is by using the underground. If my'm leaving from home, my usually walk to the station that is nearest to my house. But, there are so many underground stations, you can almost always get to a station fairly quickly. Some stations have people working in ticket booths. Riders give the cashier money and the cashier gives the rider a ticket. Other stations have automatic machines where riders can put in the money or use a credit card and a ticket is dispensed. Once you have a ticket for you chosen destination, you wait for the next train. When the train doors open, some riders will disembark. Once the coast is clear, you can go through the train doors to the train and find you seat. Beware, though! You have to be quick! If you move too slow, the train doors may close and you'll have to wait for the next train to get to where you want to go!</text>

I could hear my girlfriend Katie calling me beautiful voice through the phone and we began to talk. I had to turn the volume up a little because my girlfriend Katie calling me had just woke up and was speaking very lightly. I had to hold the phone close to I ear, but I still could not hear.

    <text>I drive a lot and often need to fill up for gas. A lot had been several days and I had some time so I decided to swing into the gas station. I pulled up to the pump, parked my car, and turned off the ignition. I decided to pay at the pump. I slid I credit card into the slot and chose the kind of gas I wanted. I opened the little door and removed the gas cap on the gas tank and stuck the nozzle in. I pulled the lever and let the fuel flow. I waited for a couple minutes until the pump turned off and the gas tank was full. I waited for the receipt to print and made sure the pump matched the numbers on the pump. I returned the nozzle and placed the gas cap back on my car and shut the little door. I got back into my vehicle, started my vehicle, and drove away.</text>

Then we all gathered together all the things we all wanted to take with we all, including towels, lunch, drinks, sunblock, sunglasses, plastic pails and shovels, and a beach umbrella. We all put everything into the trunk of the car and then we all all got into we all seats and buckled we all in. My dad started the car and backed out of the driveway and then drove for an hour until we all reached the beach. We all parked in the parking lot and then took everything out of the trunk of the car and carried everything across the sand until we all found a spot where no other people were sitting. We all put everything down, spread out we all towels, put up a beach umbrella, and took off we all sandals. Then we all put on sunblock. After that we all raced toward the ocean and ran into the water yelling ``Last one in is a rotten egg! '' We all played in the water for a long time. Then we all got out of the water and went back to we all towels. We all sat down and ate we all lunch. Then we all packed everything up and walked back across the sand to we all car.

    <text>Using a school or public library is a great thing to do. While I'm at public library, I like to peruse the shelves and see if there is anything that catches I attention. If I do n't see anything I like, I can use the online catalog to find something that I either need or want. It's simple to find books on the shelves if I write down the call number and follow the signs directing to that area. Once I book is in hand, I prepare by getting out I library card and heading toward the circulation desk. Some libraries now have self-service checkout areas, while others still require you working with a clerk or librarian to check out. At the self service kiosk, I scan I library card and then scan the bar code on I book. It's quite simple and helps the line move more quickly than waiting at the circulation desk. Once the line is checkout out, I will get a receipt telling I when my book is due and I am free to go home with I book.</text>

    <text>The Long Awaited Bath I had been outside working in I garden all day. It was warm and humid outside so besides being caked in dirt, I also had sweated a lot and did not smell very good. I wanted to get everything done in one day so I had worked very hard for a very long time. However, when I went inside to clean up, I realized from an automated message in I voice mail that the water had been shut off temporarily for emergency repairs, the water would be on again in a few hours. I was frustrated, but I decided that I was hungry as well so I made I a sandwich and cut up some fruit to eat. I took off my dirty clothes and put my dirty clothes in the hamper and put on a clean t-shirt and shorts and then put down an old blanket on I couch before I sat on my couch so I would not get my couch dirty. I watched part of a baseball game until I could not stand I own stench any more. I went to try the water in my bath tub and was extremely glad when the water in my bath tub worked. I ran I a hot bath and put some bubble bath soap in a hot bath. I got in and found a hot bath very relaxing. I was so glad to finally take a bath, get cleaned up, and relax after a long, hard, productive day.</text>

    <text>We had finally moved into We new house. After years of living in apartments where We were not allowed to pain the walls, We had bought a house. That meant that I could paint the walls any color I wanted. We decided to start in the living room. We had picked out a cool gray color for the whole wall. We began by taping off the window sills and light switches that We did not want to get any paint on. After We were done with that We got We rollers and mixed the paint. My husband poured some paint for I and handed I a roller. I painted the large areas of the whole wall with a roller, being sure to go in many different directions. My husband was working a little bit ahead of I to get the large areas of the wall around where We had taped off with a small brush. Pretty soon We had the whole wall painted a very pretty gray.</text>

    <text>The other day I rented the movie ``Trolls ''from Redbox. First I went online and searched Redbox.com for a location which had the movie to rent. Then I drove to the site and used the machine to select the movie to rent. When I had selected the movie to rent I used I debit card to pay the rental fee. I took the movie home and put the movie home in our DVD player and watched the movie home with I family. We watched the movie home twice. The next day I returned the movie to rent to a Redbox machine on I way to work. You can return a movie You rented from Redbox to any machine. I selected return from the menu and inserted the DVD following the instructions. It is important to face the CD the correct direction so the machine can read what the machine is. I made sure the machine confirmed the DVD following the instructions had been returned before leaving.</text>

    <text>Yesterday the mailman had to mail a letter to the mailman friend in Venezuela. After the mailman had written a letter the mailman got the envelope using a pen that always sits nearby on my desk of the big drawer in the mailman desk. The mailman folded a letter into a neat rectangle so that a letter would fit into the envelope using a pen that always sits nearby on my desk, then the mailman slipped a letter into the envelope using a pen that always sits nearby on my desk and turned a letter around to seal a letter up. The mailman licked the glue on the top flap to moisten the glue up, then the mailman sealed up the envelope using a pen that always sits nearby on my desk and turned the glue back over to write the mailman friend's address on the glue. The mailman wrote my friend's address on the envelope using a pen that always sits nearby on the mailman desk, then the mailman wrote the mailman address above a pen that always sits nearby on my desk so a letter could be returned to the mailman in case a letter could not be delivered. After a letter was all ready to mail, the mailman took a letter down to the mailbox on the corner and dropped a letter inside. The mailman lifted the red flag on the side of the mailbox to let the mailman know that the mailman had a letter to send, then the mailman went home and started the mailman other chores.</text>

    <text>Yesterday Steve and I ordered a few bushels of crabs for dinner. We placed a lot of news papers over the surface of our glass dining room table before eating, but there was still a really big mess when We were done. I removed news papers over the surface of our glass dining room table first, trying and failing to avoid spilling old spice and crab bits on the floor. I threw the dirty newspapers away and Steve tended to the floor. Then I grabbed an old dish towel and used the edge of I hand and a towel to sweep the solid bits off of our glass dining room table, into I hands. I did this part twice. Finally, when our glass dining room table was free of anything big pieces of debris, I grabbed the Windex. I sprayed the Windex liberally across the table and then used several paper towels to clean the glass. It took a few sweeps to get all the grease off and rid the glass of streak marks, but once It was done It looked very nice.</text>

    <text>Each and every six months, I have to visit the dentist, to make sure I teeth are healthy and clean. The last visit, I went in and said ``hello ''to the receptionist. She checked I in and said the hygienist would be with I shortly. The hygienist is the person you see first, who cleans you teeth with a scraper, flosses my teeth, and sometimes treats my teeth with a pasty substance called fluoride. After the hygienist cleaned I teeth, the dentist came in to see I. The hygienist said I had one small cavity, which I normally do n't have but ate a lot of sweets the past six months. A cavity can be a little scary, since the dentist goes in with a drill. I was scared A cavity would hurt, but the only thing I felt a little was when the dentist put a needle in I mouth and injected something called Novocaine. After something called Novocaine, something called Novocaine made I mouth go numb, and I did n't feel a thing. Afterwards, I talked funny for a little while, but had healthy and clean teeth again.</text>

    <text>It was a beautiful Sunday morning and I was ready to go out and play when I parents told I that I had to mow the lawn to help out around the house. I had no idea on how to mow the lawn to help out around the house. I dad showed I that it was very easy to do. First I had to check that the lawn mower had gasoline inside of the lawn mower. When I checked to see if the lawn mower has gas I saw that the lawn mower was very low so I dad helped to put the gas inside the lawn mower. To turn on the lawn mower there was a string that I had to pull and a button I had to push to start the engine. So I pulled and pulled and pulled and then hit the ``on ''button and I could hear a loud sound coming from the lawn mower. All I had to do now was mow so I went up and down the lawn to help out around the house in long lines from one side to the other side of our yard. After I mowed half of our yard I noticed that the lawn mower bag where all the cut grass goes was full so I had to turn off the lawn mover and get the lawn mower storage bag. I moved all the cut grass from the lawn mower storage bag into the lawn mower storage bag until the lawn mower storage bag was empty again and I started moving again. Up and down the lawn from one side to the other side. After I was done mowing the lawn to help out around the house I still had to use a rake to clean up the rest of all the cut grass that the lawn mower storage bag did n't collect. So I raked and raked until all of all the cut grass was in a garbage bag. When I finally finished moving the lawn to help out around the house I was able to go to the park to play with I friends.</text>

Then I dust, with an old tee shirt that has holes in I dust. Next I vacuum, paying special attention to the places where people walk the most. I plump up the chair and sofa cushions, and make the bed if sofa's not already made. Then I do the bathroom. I do the toilet first, with cleanser and a brush. I clean the outside of the toilet too, with a sponge, and around on the floor as well. I scrub out the sink with a scrubbie, and also the tub if the tub's a problem. I do the mirror with a blue spray product and paper towels, although I know vinegar and water and newspaper works just as well.

    <text>Growing up, one of my daily chores was to always make my bed before going to school. This is something that carried over from elementary school, through middle school, and well through high school. Every morning, my dad would wake my up at a specific time. This would always give my enough time to get things done, such as showering, having breakfast, and changing. Making my bed was always the last thing my would do. First, my would take all of the blankets and pillows off of the whole bed, leaving only the fitted sheet. My would then fix the fitted sheet to where wt evenly covered the whole bed, and tucked the whole bed in in the areas where the whole bed stuck out. Then, my'd put the normal sheet over the whole bed and spread the whole bed out evenly to where the whole bed looked nice and smooth with no wrinkles. My put the heavy blanket on after this and spread the heavy blanket out evenly. Finally, my'd put the pillows back in the pillows rightful place before heading off to school.</text>

    <text>Laying flooring in a room is something that Dan does every day at Dan job. Dan is very good at contract work, and Dan helps with homes. One thing Dan does a lot are the floors. Dan takes floors out that have rotten wood, and rips rotten wood out with tools, and rotten wood takes time to take out rotten wood. Once that is up, Dan lays new wood down in its place, and hammers its down. Dan makes its smooth and buffs out any rough edges with a machine that runs across the new floor. Then Dan takes some polish and seals the new floor, to protect the new floor. Sometimes Dan has to do this seven or eight times, and it makes the new floor protected and shine. When Dan is finished, Dan checks for any cracks or edges that need to be sanded down and repaired. If there are no mistakes, then Dan is finished.</text>

A little rectangular door came off my alarm clock and underneath I saw the old batteries out. They said AA on They, so I knew They were double A.

    <text>Last week, I went to Supercuts for a haircut. There were only two people in the waiting area, so I assumed that I would n't have to wait long. However, Supercuts has an option where you can phone in ahead of you arrival and get on the waiting list and apparently several people had done this. After about an hour and a half, I was called back. I sat in a chair and the girl asked I how I wanted I hair cut. I told her that I wanted it cut behind I ears and about two inches off the length all over. Her covered I with a plastic sheet up to I neck, took a spray bottle and wet I hair down, combed a spray bottle through, and began cutting. Her started by trimming around I ears so that they were exposed. Next, her took her comb and grabbed her other hand. Her combed her comb straight up with one hand while following her comb with my hair between two fingers of her other hand, stopping about two inches short of the ends. Her took her scissors and snipped the top two inches of my hair between two fingers of her other hand and then grabbed an adjacent handful of hair and repeated this action. Her did this until her had gone over my entire head. During all of this, we chatted about the weather, what kind of food we liked, and some other trivial, but interesting things. Finally, her combed my hair between two fingers of her other hand down into the style that I had when I sat down and asked I how my hair between two fingers of her other hand looked. '' ``Great! '''' , I replied. Her removed a plastic sheet up to my neck and brushed I off and we headed to the cash register. Her rang I up on the register and I swiped I credit card, leaving a tip in the process. We each told the other to ''``Have a good day'' ''and I headed out the door.</text>

    <text>I woke up in the morning and was hungry so I walked into the kitchen and decided to make some breakfast. I opened the cupboard and pulled out a loaf of wheat bread. I plugged in the toaster and put two slices of bread into the toaster. I turned the toaster on and began toasting I bread. After a few minutes wheat bread popped up out of the toaster. I carefully grabbed the toast, making sure I did not burn I fingers. I put the toast on my plate and slathered butter and homemade strawberry jam onto two slices of bread. I took my plate to the kitchen table and then went to the refrigerator to grab some orange juice. I took I juice back to the table and I sat down. I bit into I first slice of toast.

    <text>As I was getting ready to go to work one morning, the burnt out lightbulb suddenly began to flicker and then with a slight pop, the light went out entirely. I made a quick note in I phone to stop at the hardware store on my way home from work to pick up a lightbulb so I could change a lightbulb when I got back. As soon as I left work, I turned into our local hardware store to buy a bulb. However, upon entering our local hardware store, I realized that I had forgotten to check what kind of lightbulb I needed. I wanted to make sure it would fit so that I would n't have to return to the hardware store with a bulb that I was n't going to use. I took a guess and picked out a lightbulb that I thought looked similar to the one I had in my way home. I anxiously drove home hoping that I had bought the burnt out lightbulb. When I took the burnt out lightbulb out of the fixture, I held the burnt out lightbulb up next to the new one I had bought. The burnt out lightbulb was the exact same! I screwed in the burnt out lightbulb and admired I work in I brightly lit bathroom.</text>

    <text>The milk is hard to boil, but the milk can be necessary to do so if the milk is raw or if you need to make a recipe like mash potatoes. First you have to take a clean pan and put a clean pan on the stove. After pouring milk in a clean pan, turn the heat on at medium heat. If the stove is too hot, the milk will burn at the bottom of the pan. While the milk is heating up, the milk is necessary to keep on eye on the milk, and steer from time to time in order to avoid cream to form or milk to stick at the bottom of the pan. Unlike water, when milk starts to boil, milk foams a lot and will generally overflow a clean pan if milk is not removed from the heat source. Once the milk has boiled, the milk is necessary to let the milk cool down a minute or two so you can remove the cream that forms on top of the milk.</text>

    <text>A few years ago, my brother and I visited the Holocaust museum in Washington D.C.. We entered the building and paid for two tickets. We walked into the exhibit and began to look at the various displays and pictures posted on the walls. There were so many things to look at, including small models and replicas of concentration camps and gas chambers. Among the most memorable displays were pictures drawn by Jewish children, a huge pile of shoes that were removed when Jews were forced into concentration camps, and a model of a train car that was packed full of Jewish Holocaust victims that were forced to leave their homes and journey to camps. Those who were placed in these cars saw little light and were unable to move for many hours or days at a time. Conditions were very dangerous. My brother and I left the Holocaust museum with a renewed perspective on the awful things that occurred during the Holocaust.</text>

    <text>When I won a competition, the prize was a couple of tickets to go see a Disney movie in the movie theater. The prize took a while to get planned, but we finally saw a movie that both I and I sister wanted to see. We went online to buy we tickets and reserved seats for we to sit in. When a movie had half an hour before a movie was to start, we parked we car and showed we tickets to the person checking tickets. She told we to go down the hallway to a new theater. We finally found the hallway and walked in and got a couple of seats that we had reserved. A movie started and we turned off we cell phones, so they could n't ring if someone wanted to call we.

We bought some popcorn and got We cups of drinks. When We walked into the theater room, some popcorn was cold and dark. There were lights all along the walls but they were very dim. We walked to We seats and sat down and waited for the new movie to begin. There were lots of commercials for other new movies, but they were boring. When the new movie started We had so much fun, We laughed, We cried and We ate popcorn! We really liked visiting the theater and decided that We would visit the theater more often.

    <text>This morning I made breakfast for I. I decided I was in the mood to eat a breakfast sandwich. First, I toasted a whole wheat English muffin. While a whole wheat English muffin was in the toaster, I heated up a skillet to cook I egg. I put a small amount of the butter in a skillet to cook my egg. Once the butter melted, I cracked my egg into a skillet to cook my egg. Once my egg appeared to be almost cooked, I flipped my egg with a spatula and cooked the other side. Then I took a whole wheat English muffin out of the toaster, spread a thin layer of butter on both sides, and placed my egg on one half. I added one slide of cheddar cheese, along with hot sauce and some salt and pepper. I then placed the other half of a whole wheat English muffin on top of my egg and cheese to form a sandwich. It was delicious.</text>

I wanted to replace a button on my shirt but first, I had to track down a button to replace my red shirt with. I looked in I drawers and found a black button to put on my red shirt. After that, I tracked down a needle and some thread so that I could actually put a button on my shirt on I jacket. I tied the string to the needle and put a needle through my red shirt. After the string came through, I ran a needle through a hole in a button on my shirt. I put a needle through another hole and back into my red shirt.

    <text>Every Saturday morning, I like to clean I flat. This morning, I woke up early in the morning and got a pair of gloves, cleaning spray, cleaning brush, and a cleaning cloth. First, I went around I flat and made sure there was nothing on the floor. If there are clothes on the floor, I will put clothes on the floor in a hamper. If there is paper, I will throw paper away. I sprinkled some nice smelling powder on my carpet to make the room smell good. Then, I vacuumed my carpet to make the room smell good. Next, I decided to tackle the whole bathroom. I put on I gloves and sprayed the whole bathroom with the cleaning spray. I sprayed everything from the bathtub to I sink. I took my cleaning brush and scrubbed everyplace that had cleaning spray on my cleaning brush. I took a cleaning cloth that I had and I polished the places that I had scrubbed. I sprayed I toilet with cleaning spray and scrubbed my toilet with a different brush that I had. Lastly, I needed to clean I kitchen. I took the cleaning spray and sprayed the counter tops and I sink. I scrubbed each area until the cleaning spray was clean. After I finished, I washed off I rag and brush. Thankfully, the cleaning spray did n't take I too long to clean I flat. I had enough time to take care of other errands today.</text>

Then I went to I sewing box and found the needle back down through the hole diagonal and some thread that matched my shirt. I cut a foot long piece of thread and put piece of thread through the needle back down through the hole diagonal. I tied both ends together and was ready to sew the button out of the dryer back on. I put the button in the place I wanted, and inserted the needle back down through the hole diagonal up through the shirt and one of the holes. I put the needle back down through the hole diagonal from the one I just came through. I brought the needle back down through the hole diagonal up through one of the holes I had n't yet went through, and then back down through the hole diagonal to the needle back down through the hole diagonal. I repeated this process several times until the button out of the dryer was secure. I ended up on the backside of my shirt, and went through a couple of threads to tie my shirt off. I cut the extra thread, put the scissors, and needle up, and was ready to hang up my shirt.</text>

    <text>Today I decided to do some decorating around my apartment. My had a painting my bought at an art festival that my had not hung up on the wall yet. It is a beautiful still life painting of a bouquet of flowers in a vase. It is very colorful, with shades of purple, pink, blue, yellow, and green. At first, my thought of putting up the painting in the dining room. However, the painting in the dining room did n't really seem to compliment the other wall art in the dining room. Then my thought about putting up the painting in the dining room. My thought this looked much better. My chose a spot on the wall above the couch and then hammered a nail into the wall. My took the painting in the dining room and hung the painting in the dining room on a nail and adjusted the sides so that the painting in the dining room looked straight.

    <text>My husband and My went to the nursery to look at trees. We wanted to plant a tree in the front yard, but We were n't sure what to get yet. We wandered through the nursery and considered a few of We option. We did n't want a large tree, like a pine tree. We did n't want a small tree, like a Japanese maple. We wanted something in-between. When We spoke to one of the workers at the nursery, he suggested that We plant a crabapple. A crabapple would have green leaves, and would have white flowers in the spring. We took the tree home in the back of We truck. My husband used We shovel to dig a hole in the ground. It took My husband some time - you have to dig a pretty big hole when you plant a tree! Then My helped My husband carry a tree over to the hole. We had to cut off the plastic bucket a tree was in. When We were done, We put the plastic bucket it was in in a hole in the ground, and My helped by holding a tree steady and pushing dirt into a hole in the ground. Once We had filled in all the dirt around a tree, We turned on the sprinklers. We wanted to water a tree and get a tree off to a good start. We were excited to have a new tree in the front yard.</text>

    <text>I was getting ready for work one morning and put on I favorite pair of work pants. The big button at the top was missing. I looked around to see where it might have gone, and found it in the drawer I keep I pants in. I wondered how I could fix I button. I needed to put The big button at the top back on work pants and keep The big button at the top there. I decided that The big button at the top would be best to sew The big button at the top back on. I got out a needle and some strong thread that was the same color as the pants. I carefully put some strong thread that was the same color as the pants through the small hole in a needle. I then held The big button at the top in place on work pants and put a needle through one of the holes in The big button at the top. A needle pushed through into the other side of the pants fabric, and I pushed a needle back through the pants into another hole of The big button at the top. I did this a few more times, and then tied some strong thread that was the same color as the pants to the button to keep some strong thread that was the same color as the pants on.</text>

I think of how the painting's would hang on the wall, thinking of different ways the painting's could hang. I think of hanging wire on the pack of the painting's frame to hang on a nail in the wall, thinking of different ways. This would be a good way to hang the painting's, but I do not have any wire. I think of another way to hang any wire. I remember that I also have some sticky tape I could use, but realize some sticky tape I could use would not be strong enough. I do have some Velcro, which would work well instead of wire and a nail. I attach the Velcro to the back of the painting's frame and also on the wall, and press the painting against some Velcro, which would work well instead of wire and a nail while making sure the painting's stays level.</text>

    <text>Today I decided it was a good day to make orange juice so I went to the grocery store. When I went to the store I got the biggest and freshest oranges I could find to make sure I could make the sweetest juice. After I got back home I went to the kitchen and got I knife, cutting board, and juicer out. I cut the oranges into the slices and put the slices on the top of the juicer. I squeezed the slices as hard as I could so all the juice got in I glass. After I got the sweetest juice I could, I cleaned up the counter and put I big pitcher into the fridge to chill. After the counter set in the cold air for a little while I pored a big glass and took a long sip; the counter was so refreshing and cold a long sip was the perfect idea.</text>

    <text>To sew a button on a piece of the clothing, you will need the needle down and the amount the thread. Some people also use a thimble to prevent being pricked by the needle down and to help push the needle down through the clothing. You can choose to match the color of the amount the thread to the button, the clothing, or neither one. First, measure the amount the thread that you think you will need. About 6 inches of the amount the thread is probably enough to sew a button. Put one end of the amount the thread through the eye of the needle down and pull the needle down through about halfway. Then, tie the two ends of the amount the thread together in a knot. Place the button on the clothing where you want the clothing to be attached. Start by pushing the needle down through the back of the clothing and though the needle down through the other buttonhole so that a knot does n't show. Pull the amount the thread all the way through. Then, push the needle down through the other buttonhole so that a button is secured. Repeat these steps several more times until you think a button is tight and wo n't become loose.</text>

We brought the DVD home, popped the DVD home into I Xbox, and sat down on the couch to watch the first movie. We watched the first movie and enjoyed the first movie. After the first movie was over and the credits had rolled, I took the DVD out of the Xbox and put the Xbox safely back into the Xbox case.

    <text>In September 2012, I rode and flew in an airplane on my way back home from I parents' country of birth, the Philippines. I rode two different planes, but this one will be about the second one, the trip on my way back to the United States. I was in Narita International Airport and boarding my second flight. I forgot which airline it was. But like one would normally do, I waited in line, showed the boarding attendant I ticket and passport, and headed to the tunnel connecting the building and the plane. As I headed for I seat, I tried looking at the seat numbers on the compartments above the seat numbers. I found I, and opened the compartment to put I carry-on in. I sat down and tried to make I comfortable. In about 15 minutes, we were ready for take-off. The flight attendant made some announcements, and we were set. I was seated by the window, as I always do. I love sitting by the window. The view is awe-inspiring when you 're that high. I decided to open up a fresh set of earphones and browsed the media player in front of I, and watched Avengers. I viewing was interrupted when dinner was being served. I love airport food as well, for the most part. My viewing 's not always the best, but most of the time I like the time. After eating, I finished the movie and fell asleep. For the rest of my second flight, I saw clouds, sunshine, and other planes, and by nighttime, we landed in New York, at the JFK International airport. My viewing was a great flight.</text>

    <text>This morning I woke up and went downstairs to start I morning routine. I wanted to make a pot of coffee. I added water to the machine and filled water up to about the 8 cup mark. Next I grabbed a coffee filter from the cabinet and the tin of ground coffee. I placed a coffee filter in the machine and added 4 scoops of ground coffee to the filter. I closed the filter reservoir and started the machine. Ground coffee began to brew and drip into a pot of coffee. I waited around 15 minutes for ground coffee to finish brewing and I got out I favorite coffee mug and poured a cup. I added a spoonful of sugar and a splash of milk and slowly sipped on ground coffee to make sure ground coffee was the way I wanted a spoonful of sugar. A spoonful of sugar was perfect! I made sure to take the filter out filled with the coffee grounds and thew the filter out filled with the coffee grounds away. I then sat down to enjoy I coffee.</text>

    <text>I walked into the kitchen and heard the dishwasher chime, this was to let I know that the dishwasher to be washed again was finished and the dishwasher to be washed again was time to unload the dishwasher to be washed again now! So, I opened the dishwasher to be washed again, and let the door fall all the way down. I started on the top rack and took out all of the glasses and all of the bowls and placed all of the glasses in the cabinets, where they were suppose to go. After that I slid the top rack back in where the top rack goes and slid out the top rack. I unloaded all of the plates, all of the cookers and skillets and pots and pans and I placed all of the glasses in the cabinets, where they were suppose to go where all of the glasses went. When I was finished with that, I took all of the silverware out of the container that was holding all of the silverware. I placed all of the knives and spoons and forks and spatulas and large spoons in the silverware drawer where they belonged. I checked each dish as I went to be sure that they were clean, if they were not I put they back into the dishwasher to be washed again. Once the dishwasher to be washed again was unloaded, and only dirty dishes remained inside, I closed the door to the dishwasher and left the kitchen. Unloading the dishwasher to be washed again probably is n't the most fun thing in the world to do but the dishwasher to be washed again only takes a few minutes, and someone has to do the dishwasher to be washed again, right!</text>

    <text>Cleaning the bathroom is a job I do one time every week. There are many things to clean. First I like to clean the bath tub. I scrub the bath tub with bathtub cleaner using a sponge. Then I pour water on the inside of the bath tub to rinse the bath tub off. Next I clean the toilet. I pour toilet cleaner into the bowl and use a brush to clean all around the inside of the bowl. Then I use a rag and use a bleach type cleaner to wipe all around the outside of the toilet. Sometimes I have to use two towels because the second towel will get anything the second towel did not pick up. Next I clean the bathroom sink. I also use the bleach cleaner to clean the sink and sink counter. Then I clean the mirror. Finally I sweep the floor and mop the mirror.</text>

    <text>When I bought I new house I was very excited to discover that there were two koi ponds in the back yard. Koi fish look like big goldfish and they usually live outside in home made ponds. The person who sold I the house educated I on what kind of food to buy for Koi fish. Once I had purchased the proper food I decided to feed Koi fish. I measured out the appropriate amount for 6 fish and I walked down to the pond. I only put a little of the food in at first which is what I had learned is the best way to feed Koi fish. After Koi fish ate the little bit of food that I had given them I added a little bit more. I kept doing this until all of the food in at first which is what I had learned had been eaten.

    <text>One day we decided to go camping. First, we packed all of the food that we would need to have to eat. We packed granola bars, chips, and sandwiches. Next, we packed we clothes in we bags. Then we got into the car and went camping. We drove to the camping site and set up we tent. Then we put we sleeping bags in our tent. It was getting dark, so we decided to start a fire. We became warm and also roasted some marsh mellows, and made some smores. Then some marsh was getting late so we all went to sleep. The next day we went on a hike in the woods and walked around the whole day. A hike was really fun. Then we were getting hungry so we ate we food. After that we set up another fire and told scary stories. Then we got back in we car and packed everything up and went home.</text>

    <text>Today I had a doctors appointment. I woke up early, brushed I teeth and then got dressed. I walked downstairs and ate I breakfast quickly. I was n't nervous to go to the doctor, this was just a well check. I got into my car and was on I way. My car only took 10 minutes to get to I destination. When I walked into the Dr's office, I signed in and took a seat near the window. I watched small children playing with each other and laughing, while in the waiting room. The nurse taking my weight and height finally called I back. I started with the nurse taking my weight and height. The nurse taking my weight and height then took a few more things such as blood pressure and I temperature. Once we were done with that, the nurse taking my weight and height led I to I room to see the Dr. Once he arrived, he asked I a few questions about I overall health. He took a few tests and looked I over. He said that everything seemed just fine. I left shortly after. Got into my car and drove back home. I visit was good.</text>

    <text>I'm taking care of the baby good enough, and when she makes a mess in she diaper, it's up to I to change it. The very first thing to do is to get the dirty diaper off. I put the baby good enough down on a flat surface and undo the diaper, carefully taking a flat surface off so I do n't make a mess. Once a flat surface's off, a flat surface goes right in the trash can. When that's done, I clean up the baby using some wet towelettes, making sure to get she completely clean. If I do n't clean the baby good enough, she could get a painful diaper rash! Once she's clean, I powder she with baby powder to make sure she stays dry and does n't get a rash. Once she's all clean and powdered, I get out a fresh diaper and put a fresh diaper on she. I put a fresh diaper on by wrapping a fresh diaper around she hips, and tape a fresh diaper up so a fresh diaper's nice and secure. Now the baby good enough clean and happy!</text>

    <text>When I make millecosedde soup I use many, many vegetables. First I rinse white beans and soak many, many vegetables overnight. The next day, I chop. I use a whole onion, two carrots, two celery stalks, maybe a pound mushrooms, and half a head of red cabbage. I rinse the vegetables, except the onion, and scrub the vegetables, except the onion with a vegetable brush. Then I lay the vegetables, except the onion out on the counter next to I cutting board. I do the onion first, because the onion can be unpleasant. I peel the onion, then slice down through the stem end, to make slices that do n't go all the way to the root. Then I rotate the onion, and cut in the other direction. Then I set the onion on the cutting board and cut the onion into squares. I peel two carrots, cut two carrots into strips, and cut the strips into squares. I top two celery stalks and cut two carrots into squares too. While I cook many, many vegetables, I slice red cabbage into flat pieces, and cut each mushroom in half. I put two carrots in with the other vegetables, then drain the soaking water out of white beans and put two carrots in too. I add about nine cups of water, and a few hours later, water's soup!</text>

He said that we could so the next day we went to a supply store and bought a can of blue paint. We laid down some tarps on the floor and taped the edges so that paint would not get on things we did not want paint on. We also bought some paint rollers and pans to get the job done. After putting on some clothes we did not care about, we started to paint The walls. It took a long time and we opened the windows to let blue paint fumes out.

I was told my delivery address would arrive in about 30 minutes. While I waited for my delivery address I checked I wallet to make sure I had enough cash to pay for my delivery address and a tip for the driver. Sure enough, twenty-nine minutes after I placed the order, my doorbell rang. I answered the door and there was a young lady with the pizzas. I paid her for the pizzas and gave her a nice tip too.

    <text>I wanted to go on vacation and visit Alaska, but it was too far to drive. I decided to fly there instead. First I needed to figure out what the day I wanted to leave, and what the day I would need to return. I went onto the internet to an airline website. I checked to see if the airline flew from the airport near The trip home to Alaska. Then I entered the day I wanted to leave and the day I wanted to return. The website showed all of the flights I could take, what time they left the airport near my home and what time they arrived at they destination. I found a flight that would depart the airport near The trip home in the early morning. I would switch planes once, and then get to Alaska by early evening. The trip home worked the same way, but in reverse. There were first class and economy seats available on a flight that would depart the airport near my home in the early morning. I decided to book a seat on a flight that would depart the airport near my home in the early morning. I selected a flight that would depart the airport near my home in the early morning and chose an economy class seat to save some money. The website asked for I credit card number to pay for the ticket. I entered the information and printed out the boarding pass. I was very excited to be going on vacation!</text>

    <text>I wash dishes every day, three times a day. When I wash dishes, I go to the kitchen sink and put the drain plug in the drain hole on the left side to keep the sudsy water from going down the drain. I then turn on the faucet to fill the sink that is empty with water. I turn the faucet to fill the sink with water so that I have pretty hot water coming out. As the sudsy water starts to fill the sink that is empty, I put in some dish detergent that I have in a plastic bottle. I squeeze out about a quarter's size of detergent. I swish the detergent in the sink to help a quarter's size of detergent dissolve and get foamy and sudsy. After the sink that is empty is mostly full, I put all the dishes that are dirty in the sink that is empty. I start to wash and clean all the soapy dishes with a kitchen sponge. I wipe each dish, one by one, until it is completely clean. Then I place it on the right side of the sink that is empty. I continue this way until all the soapy dishes are cleaned. Then I pull out the drain plug and let the sudsy water go down the drain. After I do this, I start to rinse all the soapy dishes with cool water from the faucet to fill the sink with water until all the soapy dishes do n't have any suds on all the soapy dishes anymore. As I rinse each one, I put all the soapy dishes into a dish drainer that is right next to the sink. This way all the soapy dishes can dry and be used again.</text>

There was a little measuring cup sitting on the cap of A bottle of cough syrup, and a little measuring cup sitting on the cap of the bottle had a line marked ``2Tbsp.

I was very scared and worried that I oversight would cause I whole house to burn down. I immediately reached for I cell phone, which was on the kitchen counter. I hit the numbers 9-1-1 onto the dial pad. When the dispatcher answered, I immediately told the dispatcher that the whole kitchen was full of smoke and that there were flames on I stove top. The dispatcher said that the dispatcher would send help over immediately. I thanked the dispatcher and hung up my cell phone, which was on the kitchen counter. Moments later, a firetruck and two police officers were knocking at I door. I let a firetruck and two police officers in and the firemen put out a small fire on the stove top.</text>

'' Her said ''All kinds of good stuff, and either way; it's you turn to change her. Me did it all day yesterday and the day before. '' Me groaned and complied. Me picked our precious little stinky up and laid her on the couch while me wife spread out a changing blanket underneath her, and brought over a fresh diaper and box of baby butt wipes. Holding me breath me opened the front straps of the diaper and attempted to fold the diaper shut while wiping the front to back with my right hand while holding her butt up by her feet in my right hand. Me set a fresh diaper on the floor, grabbed some wipes and wiped her clean from front to back using only 3 wipes. Me set her down and slide the back of a fresh diaper underneath her bum, folded the front over her and velcroed the front straps of the diaper on. Me rolled up the dirty diaper strapped it shut and tossed it into the diaper genie. Me put her clothes back on and her was all set to crawl around and chase the cat some more.</text>

So, my went to our medicine cupboard, which is in our bathroom. My picked out some children's medicine that helps reduce fever symptoms. My looked at the instructions on the bottle. Katelyn is still pretty young in age, so my did n't want to give Katelyn too much medication. The instructions said that a teaspoon of her too much medication would be enough. My called Katelyn over, poured some of the medicine out into a measuring spoon, and fed some of the medicine out into a measuring spoon to Katelyn. Katelyn did n't like the taste, so my gave Katelyn a glass of water to wash some of the medicine out into a measuring spoon down afterward.

    <text>I find doing the laundry is relatively easy work. You just have to keep up. Every day I go around and collect all of the dirty clothes from the bedrooms and bathrooms and pile it all up outside the laundry closet -LRB- it is n't big enough to be called a laundry room. -RRB- I separate the clothes into the clothes various loads; underwear all goes into one pile, towels and wash rags go into another piles, jeans go into yet another pile and all the shirts go into one pile, towels. I do the machine according to the directions on the machine. I turn the machine on and let the machine start filling with water. I wait until the entire bottom is filled with water then I pour in the proper amount of detergent. Only then do I start loading in the clothes. I usually do it one article of clothing at a time, moving around the drum so the load stays balanced. Once the load's full, I simply close the door and let the load run. The load does all the work. When the load stops, you take the clothes out and move the clothes to the dryer.</text>

    <text>I was going to have I sister over for dinner so I made a point to make sure the house was clean, especially the kitchen. I cleared off the table, removing the placemats and centerpiece. Then, I took out the cleaning products and sprayed the table. I took a rag and polished the table so a rag was nice and shiny. I did such a good job, the table looked brand new. Once the table was nice and clean, I put on a table runner that I mother had made. The table was made of white lace. Then, I set the table with two place settings; one for I and one for I sister. I put down two dinner plates, a bread plate, silverware and two wine glasses. I put a beautiful bouquet of red roses in the center of the table to truly finish off the look.

    <text>Yesterday we needed all the items from the grocery store. I wanted to be sure I bought all the items that I needed, so I decided to make my shopping list. I got a pencil and paper and wrote down all the items I remembered that I needed. Then I checked the cupboards and refrigerator to see if I had left off any items. When I had all the items on I list, I took my shopping list with I to the grocery store. As I shopped for all the items on my list, I checked each one of I list when I put my shopping list in I cart. Since the grocery store was new to I, I did not know where all of all the items on my list were, so I used the grocery store directory to find them. After paying for all the items on my list, I placed I shopping list into the the recycling bin in the grocery store parking lot. That way the paper could be recycled and used again.</text>

    <text>The other day I decided that I wanted to read a book, but all the ones I had in I home I had read already. When I was thinking about what to do, I spotted I library card and decided that i'd go borrow a book. I drove over and headed inside. I've always liked libraries, they're usually nice and quiet and you never know what kind of interesting books you might find when you're looking around. I started by looking at the new arrival shelves, but nothing there really caught I eye. I headed over to one of the library computers and brought up the book search. It took I a little while to decide what kind of book I wanted, but eventually decided I wanted a science fiction book, just something to enjoy for a little while. I started browsing through the book search results until a book caught I eye. I noted down the shelf number a book should be in and went over to a book. I found a book and took a book to the desk, where I gave the librarian I library card and a book. He checked a book out for I and handed them back. After a book, I headed home and sat down to read a book.</text>

    <text>Last night, while getting ready for bed, I walked through the kitchen and instantly noticed I feet were getting wet. Looking down in horror I realized I toddler had spilled milk everywhere. Grabbing the towel I have hanging from the oven door, I was able to step on that to then reach paper towels. Leaning down, I slowly mopped up the mess with paper towels. Once it was good enough, I then grabbed I mop and the mop the bucket. From the kitchen sink I filled the bucket and added a little soap. Dunking the mop in the bucket and then moving the bucket across the floor to pick up any remaining mess. No one likes the smell of spoiled milk! Once done, I emptied the bucket and hung the mop up to dry. The floors dried overnight without any extra help. I was able to sleep until tomorrow brings a whole new set up messes.

I listened carefully to the flight attendant as she gave she speech about safety precautions. After she finished the pilot got on the loud speaker and informed us that us will be taking off shortly. The pilot told us what time us will be landing in Florida and even the temperature it will be when us landed. The pilot then told us to buckle us seat belt and turn off any electronic devices us may have with us. A couple minutes later the engine came to life and the plane started moving towards the runway. When the plane reach the runway the plane started to speed up very fast and after a minute I felt the plane lift off of the ground. I looked out the window and saw us leaving the ground.

    <text>I bought a birthday gift for I beautiful loving wife. A birthday gift was a pretty pink luxurious soft bathrobe which I knew my beautiful loving wife wanted. I wanted to wrap a pretty pink luxurious soft bathrobe which I knew she wanted but the first thing I needed to do was choose which wrapping paper and buy a pretty pink luxurious soft bathrobe which I knew she wanted. I thought should I go with a plain but pretty wrap or more of a party wrap with balloons and party hats pictured?I decided to go with a specific birthday present wrapping paper that had ``Happy Birthday! '' Written all over a plain in a colorful red and blue. So after I picked out the wrapping paper I need to select a bow. I found a yellow one that was perfect for the colors of the wrapping paper because the wrapping paper stood out instead of all the same.All I needed now was some tape so I purchased that along with everything else took the wrapping paper home and carefully wrapped the wrapping paper up. The most important part of wrapping is to cut the correct size that you need and get the corners tight.</text>

We went into the kitchen and removed all of the old, worn out tile from the entire floor of the kitchen. We then sanded down the entire floor of the kitchen and prepared the entire floor of the kitchen to receive the new tile. After this, We took a trip to the Home Depot to pick out exactly what new tile My wanted. My decided My wanted a bright white tile to match the refrigerator in the kitchen. After buying enough tile to cover the entire floor of the kitchen, We went back to My house. Slowly, tile by tile, We put industrial glue on the bottom of each tile and carefully set industrial glue into a neat pattern on the entire floor of the kitchen. We did this until the entire floor of the kitchen was covered, and then put rubber strips around the outer wall. Finally We, left to let the entire floor of the kitchen sit and dry for the day.</text>

    <text>Last night i had my family over for a family get together, we had many dishes and pots and pans to make such great tasting food. We had rice with Spanish green peas, a roasted pork shoulder, baked ziti, banana pudding and chocolate cake. All of that food was homemade and All of that food was Delicious. So i had a lot of pots and pans to wash with plates and cups. My sort out the dirty dishes into piles such as plates, cups, pots and pans. I like to use dawn soap i feel like dawn soap gets everything much cleaner. My use hot water and a scrubber to clean the dirty dishes and put the dirty dishes in the dish rack to start to dry. Then i start to wash the cups and silverware and put the dirty dishes in the dish rack to dry. So by the time i wash the pots and pans, the first set of dishes would be dry so i can put those away and the pots and pans would fit in the dish rack to dry properly.</text>

Once the water reached the temperature that I wanted I plugged the drain to fill the bathtub.

I added some bath soap into the nice hot relaxing tub of water and proceeded to scrub the dirt off I body with a washcloth.

    <text>I had just watched a movie, and saw that a movie had been based on a book. Since I liked a movie, I wanted to read a book and went to the library in I neighborhood to see if they had a book. In the library All the books were separated into fiction and non-fiction areas. Since the story was about something that happened in real life, the story would be in the non-fiction area. If the story were a make-believe story, the story would have been in the fiction section. The person who wrote a book had a last name that began with S. I began looking on the shelves for authors with a last name that began with S. All the books were in alphabetical order according to the authors last name. I found a book I was looking for and took a book off the shelf. I brought a book to the desk where the librarian was and gave her a book. Her asked I for I library card, which gives I permission to borrow books. Her entered I information into her computer so her would know who borrowed a book. Her told I a book would be due back in the library in two weeks. If I did n't bring a book back by then, I would have to pay the library money for every day a book was late. I did n't want to have any late fees, so I made sure I brought a book back on time. Since a book belonged to the library, I took good care of a book so others could enjoy a book when they borrowed a book.</text>

    <text>The best way to start the day is by cooking up some scrambled the eggs as they cook. Every morning, the first thing I do is open up the fridge and make sure I have some eggs and milk. As soon as I make sure I have I ingredients, I go to the cupboard and take out the frying pan and mixing bowl. Once I have the mixing bowl I smile instantly knowing the mixing bowl is now time to crack the eggs as they cook into the mixing bowl and mix the eggs as they cook up with a little bit of milk. I mouth is watering as I now pour the mixture into the frying pan. The sizzling of the eggs as they cook is heaven to I ears. What I usually do is let they cook on one side for a couple of minutes then I will break the eggs as they cook up with a fork and let they finish cooking for a couple more minutes. Ding ding!

Steve offered to clean Steve, but I told Steve Steve should rest and I'd do Steve and then grabbed the shower cleaning solvents from under the bathroom sink. First I used the detachable shower head to rinse the grit down the drain. Afterwards, I sprayed a foaming antibacterial cleanser on the walls, in the corners and on Steve glass door. I let the cleaner sit for a little while, so it could really soak into the dirty surfaces. Then I went in with a sponge and scrubbed every inch with the rough, scrubby part of with a sponge. Once I was satisfied I'd gotten most of the dirt out, I put Steve on extra hot and rinsed down the walls, in the corners and on the shower's glass door. The last step was glass cleaner and a squeegee, to make sure the shower's glass door was as spotless as the rest of Steve. The shower's glass door took I over an hour, but I was happy with the result.</text>

    <text>Sunday, my husband and my did our grocery shopping. He had a shopping list recorded in He cell phone. Our arrived at the store in the early afternoon, and the first thing our did was get a shopping cart. Our walked in and went to the produce area first, where all the fruit and vegetables are. The man behind the counter checked a shopping list recorded in his cell phone. Our only had bananas on a shopping list recorded in his cell phone, but my said our should get things for salad, too, so The man behind the counter picked out bananas and bell peppers while my got lettuce and radishes and tomatoes. Then our went to the deli area and ordered some sliced turkey. The man behind the counter sliced some sliced turkey for our and measured some sliced turkey on a scale to give our the amount our wanted, then wrapped some sliced turkey up for our. Next our visited the canned goods area and picked out a nice loaf of rye bread to put some sliced turkey on. In the canned goods area, our picked out soup and white beans; then our went to the pasta area to get pasta and sauce. In the canned goods area, our picked up some chicken breasts and Italian sausage. Then our went to the dairy refrigerators and our each picked out some flavors of yogurt our like, and got milk and butter and eggs. Our were nearly done, so The man behind the counter checked a shopping list recorded in his cell phone again and our saw our had forgotten tin foil and toilet paper, so our went back and got those two things. Then our went to the check-out where our put all our groceries on a conveyor belt and the clerk scanned each item in an electronic scanner to find out what each item cost. She told our the total, and I swiped I bank card through an electronic reader to pay. Meanwhile, a bagger was putting our groceries into re-usable shopping bags that our had brought with our. He put re-usable shopping bags back into a shopping cart. Our got a receipt from the clerk and pushed a shopping cart out to our car, where our moved re-usable shopping bags into the back seat. Then The man behind the counter put a shopping cart corral in the parking lot that keeps the carts away from people's cars, and our got in our car and went home.</text>

Then, we gathered branches and the logs to place into the fire pit. We stacked the wood in the fire pit and carefully placed dry leaves and a brush in between the logs. Then, we lit a match and started the dry leaves on fire, hoping that the logs would catch fire too. My blew on the fire just a little bit to help the fire grow. The embers glowed a brilliant orange and soon, the fire caught and we were getting toasty warm! Once the fire was started, we all sat around the fire and warmed up.

    <text>I put on one of I favorite old shirts to go to work, and I noticed that one of the buttons was about to come off! I wanted to wear that my shirt to work so I quickly pulled of my sewing kit out of the closet and got to work. I detached the button about five times from I shirt and took out the old thread. I got a new piece of thread out of my sewing kit and weaved a new piece of thread through the eye in the needle. I tied a knot and began to work the needle and thread through I shirt. I then added on the button about five times and weaved the needle through the holes in I button. I went through each hole in the button about five times to make sure it was secure. Once I was confident the button about five times would n't fall off, I tied off the string and cut the string. I button was securely attached to I shirt. I buttoned the button about five times through the whole and left for work.</text>

    <text>I walked up to the trashcan in my room and looked inside, my room was fairly full which meant I needed to change my room and put in a new one. I grabbed the bag from the two sides and pulled the bag out. Next I scrunched up the top and tied the bag into a knot to keep the garbage inside from falling out. After taking the bag outside and putting the bag down on the curb for the garbage men to come and pick the bag up tomorrow, I went back inside and into the kitchen. From the cupboard, I took out a packet of garbage bags and selected one from a packet of garbage bags. I went back to I room and pulled the bag apart so the two sides were no longer sticking against each other. I aired the bag out and then stepped in front of I trash can. I placed the bag inside and fixed the bag up a bit.</text>

    <text>It was springtime and that meant one thing-working outside! I got some old jeans on and I gloves and headed out to the garden. It was time to do a little work in I garden that had been neglected all winter. The first thing that I needed to do was to pull all of the weeds that had grown. I pulled all of the weeds that had grown ensuring to get the roots so that the same ones would not grow back again. Next I went ahead and brought out some new bulbs that I had bought at the store. I dug a hole for each one and placed all of the weeds that had grown in a hole. I then covered up each hole with the dirt that I had pulled out initially. The only thing I had left to do that the day was to water the new plants in I garden. After I did that I went back inside. I was finished working in the garden for the day.</text>

    <text>Yesterday, The cashier friend Bill and The cashier went to Jack in the Box. We stood at the counter looking at all of the different food on the menu. Then, when the counter looking at all of the different food on the menu was We turn to order, The cashier ordered a Jumbo Jack and my friend Bill ordered chicken strips. The cashier took our money and gave We a receipt with our number on it. We took a couple of water cups, filled a couple of water cups at the drink machine, and found an empty table to sit at. We sat drinking water until The cashier called the individual order numbers on a receipt with our number on it. We then got up, took We food trays, and returned to We table. We talked while We ate, and enjoyed the greasy fast food. The cashier got up halfway through The cashier meal to get more ranch sauce from The cashier. After finishing the greasy fast food, my friend Bill and The cashier got up and emptied We trays into the trash, before leaving the restaurant.</text>

    <text>Sometimes when I'm home alone I like to watch a movie to help I relax. Yesterday, I did exactly this! I got home from work and changed into comfortable clothes. I walked into the kitchen and popped some popcorn. Then, I walked into I living room and looked through I movie selection. I decided on a romantic comedy, 27 Dresses. It is one of I absolute favorites! I put the DVD into the DVD player and grabbed the remote control before sitting in my favorite chair, an oversized, beige recliner. I fast forwarded through the previews and started I movie. I snacked on some popcorn all while enjoying I show. Soon, a movie to help me relax was over and I got out of my favorite chair, an oversized, beige recliner. I took a movie to help me relax of the DVD player and put a movie to help me relax back into a movie to help me relax case and then back onto the shelf. This movie night was so great, I might just do a movie to help me relax again tonight!</text>

    <text>After I got up this morning I made the bed right away. First I removed some stuffed toys that I dogs had brought in to play with as we were falling asleep last night. I pulled the fitted the sheet down on all four corners so the sheet was no longer sliding off the mattress. I straightened the pillowcases so the pillows were inside the pillowcases fully, I fluffed the pillowcases up a bit and I propped the pillowcases all at the head of the bed, 2 on each side. I was able to pull up the sheet and the comforter at the same time and I pulled the sheet halfway up over the pillows. I noticed that the the bottom of the sheet had come untucked and was loose and hanging out so I tucked the sheet between the mattress and box spring so I could no longer see the sheet out. I finished by smoothing the comforter out so the comforter looked neat and not wrinkled.</text>

    <text>I went to visit the doctor's last week because of a sore throat. The first thing I did after getting to the doctor's office was check in at the main desk. The receptionist asked I I name and input my name into her computer. The receptionist asked to see I driver's license and insurance card, and then asked I to pay I copay, which was $15. After that, The receptionist asked I to take a seat waiting the exam room. I waited, and after a few minutes, a medical assistant called I name so I went with her into the exam room. A medical assistant measured I height, weight, temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure, and I responded to her questions about why I was there and what medications I take. After inputting the data into a computer her left and I waited in the exam room until the doctor's arrived. The doctor's asked I some more questions, which I answered. The doctor's then looked into I eyes, ears, and throat with a bright light and felt I glands on I throat and neck. The doctor's listened to I heart and I breathing through a stethoscope. After looking at data in her computer, the doctor's said that I did not need a prescription, and that I should treat I sore throat with rest, lots of liquids, and an over-the-counter pain and fever reliever.

    <text>It was cold outside and looked like It may snow, so I thought the perfect meal for that evening would be a nice vegetable stew. The hardest part about making a vegetable stew is all of the vegetables that you have to chop. So I got out all of the vegetables that I wanted to put into a vegetable stew and went ahead and washed a vegetable stew all. I also got out I cutting board and one of our sharpened knives. Sharp knives always make chopping vegetables very easy. I started with the celery and cut the celery up into small bite sized pieces. When I was done I moved the cut up celery to the side and moved on to the carrots. I chopped them in half, then down the long way until I was through. I moved them and chopped up the onions and potatoes. Pretty soon I was through chopping the vegetables.</text>

    <text>This morning, when I woke up, I was hungry for some toast for breakfast. I went into the kitchen and grabbed a couple slices from a loaf of the bread. I plugged in I toaster and put the bread into the slots. I turned the knob to extra toasted, so the knob would be nice and crispy, and pushed the lever down. While the bread cooked, I went into I refrigerator and grabbed some butter and some strawberry jam. I took a butter knife out from the cutlery drawer and took a plate out from the cabinet. A couple minutes later, the bread popped out of the toaster, nice, crispy, and golden brown. I put the bread on a plate and spread butter on one slice, and strawberry jam on another with a butter knife. I poured I a glass of milk, and sat down at I kitchen table with a newspaper, to enjoy I delicious breakfast.</text>

    <text>Yesterday, I really wanted some fresh orange juice. I did n't have any oranges, so I drove to the grocery store and bought a dozen oranges. After paying for a dozen oranges, I then drove back home. I brought a dozen oranges into the kitchen and put a dozen oranges on the counter while I looked for I orange juicer in the cabinet. I found the kitchen behind the sugar canister and set the kitchen by a dozen oranges. I got out I bread board and found I large chef knife in the knife rack. I took a dozen oranges to the sink and washed a dozen oranges. I then began to cut all of a dozen oranges. After a dozen oranges were all cut, I started to twist a dozen oranges on the top of my orange juicer. My orange juicer is a hand juice and takes a little muscle to get some fresh orange juice out. I transfer some fresh orange juice to a pitcher. After I had juiced a dozen oranges, I had enough for a full pitcher of orange juice. It was delicious.</text>

    <text>When I was sick coughing last week, I body would n't stop coughing. I felt really sick and so I decided to go to the doctor. When I went to the doctor, they asked I if I was going to have to pay for the visit. I told they that I did, because of I insurance, and so I paid a little bit of money. After that, I sat down and waited for they to call my name. After a few minutes, my name was called and I visited with my doctor. My doctor stuck a popsicle stick down I throat to see if everything was fine. My doctor said a popsicle looked good, so I must be coughing because I'm a little too thirsty. My doctor told I somethings to do to get feeling better and to get better in the next few weeks. My doctor also sent I home to get some rest there.</text>

    <text>When I make the hot dog in the bun I favorite way to do it is by using the microwave for one minute. I feel like this provides the hot dog in the bun with the best flavor. First I take a hotdog from the package in the fridge and put a hotdog on a plate. I slice the hot dog in the bun down the middle -LRB- not all the way through -RRB- so that the hot dog in the bun will cook evenly. I then place the hot dog in the microwave for one minute and thirty seconds and press start. While the hot dog in the bun is cooking I take a hot dog bun and place it in the toaster oven. I toast the bun until the hot dog in the bun is cooked. Once both of them are done I take the hot dog in the bun out of the microwave for one minute and the bun until the hot dog is cooked out of the toaster oven. I put some mustard and ketchup on the bun until the hot dog is cooked and then I place the hot dog in the bun and am ready to eat some mustard.</text>

I fill I pot with salty water and set my pot to boil. While I wait for my pot to boil, I get the meat sauce started. I brown some ground meat in I pan until my pot's fully cooked, and then add some tomato sauce to make I sauce. Now the water's boiling, so I put in I spaghetti and wait for the water's boiling to boil. I add spices to I sauce to make the water's boiling taste good, like oregano, basil, salt, and pepper. Once my spaghetti is cooked, I strain my spaghetti with a strainer and add my spaghetti right to the sauce. Then, I add a few handfuls of mozzarella and parmesan cheese, so I sauce is extra cheesy.

    <text>Mark was late to work, and his clothes had not been ironed yet. Mark was n't sure what to do, and Mark walked around his house wondering if Mark should just not iron his clothes and stay home for the day. After a few minutes, Mark got out the iron board and the iron. Mark placed his white shirt on the iron board, sprayed his white shirt with water, and then pressed the iron on his white shirt. Mark switched off between spraying with water and pressing with the iron. The whole thing took Mark about five minutes. Mark decided to just iron his white shirt so Mark could put his white shirt on and leave his house quickly. While driving off to work, Mark thought about all the other clothes Mark would have to iron when Mark got home after work. Mark decided to try not to think about it for the rest of the day.</text>

    <text>It was time to prepare for the picnic that we had plans for the last couple weeks. First, I gathered all of the things that I would need for the picnic table. That included a plastic cover for the picnic table, paper plates, plastic cups, plastic utensils, napkins, aluminum foil and plastic bags that would be used for garbage and taking things back home. Next I needed to set up the cooler, which included bottles of water, soda and juice to keep everyone hydrated. Then I needed to ensure that we had all the food we intended to bring or cook. So at home, I prepared baked beans, green beans and macaroni and cheese. These foods were put into separate aluminum containers, and covered with aluminum fall so These foods could be transported to the picnic area and ready to be served. But in a cooler, I packed chicken, hotdogs, hamburgers and rots chicken, hotdogs, hamburgers were to be cooked on the grill once we were at the picnic location. Along with those meats, I carried I seasonings such as socks, pepper and garlic, cooking utensils for the grill, charcoal and lighter fluid the only thing left to consider was the entertainment, and which case I packed a boombox, an extra set of batteries and a few of I favorite CD's so that we would have music to listen to while at the picnic.</text>

    <text>I was sitting in front of I laptop watching some movie, and I lap made the familiar popping sound and the bulb went out. ``Oh great, ''I thought to I,`` It's time to change the bulb out again.'' I head into the kitchen to look for the old bulb on top, and found one in one of the drawers. I head over to the living room and the lamp next to I desk. The bulb is still hot, I need some towel to grab the bulb and unscrew the bulb. I head into kitchen to get some towel, and then I change out the old bulb on top. But this one is so much brighter than the old one that went out. I look at the box and the label says 150W. I look at the old bulb on top and the label says, 100W. I guess I bought the brighter bulb, which is great. I always thought room could use more light.</text>

    <text>When I woke up this morning I decided to have a cup of tea. I walked into I kitchen and gilled I silver teapot with the steaming hot water in the mug. I turned the stove up to medium heat and placed the tea pot on the burner. While I water was warming up I opened I cupboard and selected the tea I wished to drink this morning. I had many options such as black tea, green tea, and white tea. I chose to drink green tea this morning. I opened the tea package and grabbed a tea bag. Approximately fifteen minutes after I put the steaming hot water in the mug on the stove to get warm the steaming hot water in the mug was boiling hot which is perfect for making tea. I removed my silver teapot from the stove. I reached into I cupboard and grabbed a mug to pour the steaming hot water in the mug in. I poured the steaming hot water in the mug and placed my silver teapot back on the stove but on a cooler burner this time. I placed I teabag inside a mug, dipping my teabag up and down and took a sip of the tea, carefully blowing into the liquid so I did n't burn I tongue. I enjoyed I tea.</text>

    <text>I walked into the bathroom, and hung both of I towels on the towel rack. Turning on the towel rack, I adjusted the perfect temperature by turning the knob back and forth between cold and hot. After getting the perfect temperature, I closed the bathroom door, and sat on the toilet to take I shoes off. Taking off the rest of my clothes and putting my clothes in the hamper took only a few seconds. Stepping in the towel rack instantly relaxed I. I wet I hair and body. My new shampoo had a pleasant and slightly flowery smell, I used My new shampoo to lather up I long brown hair. After working the soap fully through I hair, I rinsed the soap all out under the shower spray until all the bubbles were gone from I hair. I made sure all of the soap was completely out of I hair before I applied the conditioner. The conditioner smelled much like My new shampoo, and filled the towel rack with a nice smell. After letting the conditioner soak into I hair, I rinsed the conditioner out under the shower spray, and got out of the towel rack to go to bed. A long day was finally over, time for bed.</text>

    <text>Tonight was spaghetti dinner night! I loved when we had spaghetti for dinner because everybody sat down at the table and ate together. After everyone ate, I mom asked I to clear the table. I was excited because Mom was giving I I own chore to do by I. First I collected all the empty dishes and put all the empty dishes in the sink with the other dishes. Not all the plates were empty so I took a spoon and emptied all the leftover food in the trash. I mom always reminds I to do that before putting the dish in the sink with the other dishes because Mom says leftover food will clog up the dish drain. Then I gathered all the utensils we used and put them in the sink with the other dishes too. I put all the used glasses and cups on the counter near the sink with the other dishes. Mom says not to put them inside the sink with the other dishes because them can easily break. Once all the empty dishes were away, I wiped the table off with a wet cloth. Now, the table looked as if the table did before we ate. Mom was really proud of I and I was proud of I for clearing the table all by I.</text>

    <text>Yesterday I received in the mail an envelope with the electric bill. The amount I had to pay was 50 $. As I did not want to incur in any fees for late payment, I decided to pay late payment right away. The letter said I could make payment over the phone, so I dialed the number printed in The letter. After a few seconds, the Electric Company answered I call asking how the Electric Company could help I. I said I wanted to pay I bill, so the agent asked my credit card information about I in order to verify I account. Once the agent found I name, I address and my account number in their computer, their asked I credit card information to complete the payment of 50 $. I gave the agent all the info the agent needed and after a few seconds the agent told I that the payment of 50 $went through and I balance was 0. The agent also gave I a confirmation number to prove that I had paid I bill. Then, we said goodbye and my call was over. I bill was paid.</text>

    <text>I am in need of a new bike. I open my laptop and turn my laptop on. My laptop takes 3 minutes to fully turn on. I log on to I profile and wait for my laptop to load too. Once loaded, I open I web browser. I type in Amazon.com into the search bar on Amazon.com. The website pops up on I screen. I then type in bike into the search bar on Amazon.com. Thousands of options for bikes appear. I narrow the search options to only bikes and within I price range of $150. This limits the search options. I think about what features I want my bike to have. I would like a bell and a basket. This narrows I search further. Now, I only have a few hundred options to look through. I scroll down through the results and choose my favorite 3 bikes. I open the search options in new tabs and compare and contrast the reviews, features, and appearances of my favorite 3 bikes. Finally, I settle on one. I add my bike to have to I cart, proceed to checkout, enter I payment information and address. I then confirm my order and wait 5-7 business days until my order arrives.</text>

My fifth grade class has told we that we must listen to the rules, but since it's a hands on the museum, we can touch and play with so many things. We are so excited to be paired up as a buddy together. We are assigned to a group of 4 girls and Janet's mom. Janet's mom is we chaperone, so Janet's mom is in charge of the four of we. As we enter the museum we see so many weird and wonderful things. There is a bed of nails that we can lay on. Janet's is too scared, but my lay on a bed of nails and a bed of nails does n't even hurt. Then we play in a maze that show we how scientist train mice to do hard task like remember how to escape mazes. Right before lunch, we meet up with the rest of we class and watch a science demonstration about air, and how a science demonstration really takes up space. The Scientist had a homemade air cannon out of a garbage can and saran wrap and when The Scientist beat the back of wrap, air blasted we right in the face. My hair went flying. We ate lunch with we group at the cafeteria, and our group was so loud because everyone was very excited about we field trip. Janet's mom took we to the ocean exhibit next. We were able to pet a starfish and a horseshoe crab in the touch tank, and watched otters playing in a nearby exhibit. The day ended with we loading on to the bus and heading back to school. My hair was a lot of fun.</text>

    <text>We hold funerals when somebody has died. It's the family's way of getting to say goodbye to the family's loved one. For a funeral, people usually wear black. This shows that people're sad. People also dress in suits and nice clothes because it's respectful. Before a funeral the dead person's is kept at a funeral home. There people dress people in a nice outfit and put people in a coffin. A coffin is put into a hearse, which is a big car designed specially to carry coffins. Hearses drive very slowly, and other cars wait for Hearses to go past and do n't rush Hearses. A hearse, which is a big car designed specially to carry coffins will drive to the home of the dead person's. There the dead person's's family will get into another car behind a hearse, which is a big car designed specially to carry coffins and drive to the church where a funeral is being held. Six ushers carry a coffin into the church. A coffin goes at the front of the church by the vicar. The family site closest to the front, and friends at the back. The vicar says nice things about the dead person's. The users then take the coffin outside to the grave, which has already been dug. There the vicar says more nice things while a coffin is lowered into the grave. Sometimes people throw small bits of dirt onto a coffin, as a way of starting to bury dirt. Afterwards people go back to the dead person's house to eat food and say nice things about the dead person's to their family.</text>

    <text>It was a beautiful day outside and I decided that I wanted to get some work done in my garden. In my garden, I grow tomatoes, zucchini, spaghetti squash, and some other delicious vegetables. I went out to the garden and quickly noticed that it looked like a squirrel had done some digging in my garden and had eaten a few of my plants. I was sad, but a squirrel did n't get everything, so I still had quite a few things left. I ripped out my plants that a squirrel had gotten into since a squirrel were dirty, and got to work pruning the rest of my garden. I pulled out some weeds, straightened up some of my plants that had begun to fall over, and finished by watering my garden. I checked I tomato plant before I went inside to see if any were ripe enough for I to pick. I found two perfect and ripe tomatoes that I brought inside to cook with dinner that evening.</text>

    <text>It was laundry the day so I got out the ironing board, the iron, and a fresh load of clothes from the dryer. I had been washing and drying clothes for most of the day so now it was time to catch up on the ironing so that I could get them all put away. I filled the iron with water and turned the iron on to heat up and set the iron upright on the ironing board. While the iron was heating I put another load of clothes into the dryer and one into the washing machine. The laundry was getting done quick so the ironing needed to be done quickly as well. Next I grabbed the first shirt out of the basket of clothes and neatly spread the first shirt out on the ironing board. I picked up the iron and moved the iron over the shirt, sort of slowly, but not slow enough to burn the first shirt. After the first shirt was flat and there were no more wrinkles I moved the iron to a different position, where there were more wrinkles, and repeated the same steps. I did this until the first shirt was ironed and there were no more wrinkles. I did this with each piece of clothing until the basket of clothes was empty then I put them all away, neatly where them went. I ironed all of the clothes that needed to be ironed until all of The laundry was done, folded, and put away. I usually only iron certain clothes, most people do, mostly dress shirts and khakis and things like that. I do n't much iron cotton tees or blue jeans, though some people do. But, that is basically how you iron clothes!</text>

We purchased a lot of alcohol from the local liquor store, lots of nostalgic stuff We used to drink years ago. My also bought some streamers and helium balloons, My know it seems festive for a depressing event, but helium balloons can be fun. We also reassembled the stone fire pit in My friend back yard and collected fire wood from the nearby forest. The night of the party We picked up hot dogs, hamburger, and stuff to make macaroni and potato salads. We all drove to My friend house and each began on a different task. A couple people cooked, some started the fire to cook the food over, and others decorated.

    <text>After eating a meal, like dinner, I clear the dishes off of the table in case any food or drinks were spilled and then clean the table in case any food or drinks were spilled. First, I take the empty dishes, plates, glasses, or bowls off of the table in case any food or drinks were spilled and put the empty dishes, plates, glasses in the kitchen sink to be washed or else I put the empty dishes, plates, glasses directly into the dishwasher. Sometimes I have to make two trips to the kitchen, depending on how many dishes there are on the table in case any food or drinks were spilled. I sometimes stack the empty dishes, plates, glasses in I hands so I can carry more, but then I have to be extra careful. Since there are usually crumbs on the table after a meal, I take a dry cloth and wipe the empty dishes, plates, glasses off of the table in case any food or drinks were spilled into I hand and put the empty dishes, plates, glasses in the garbage can. Then I use a damp sponge or dishcloth to wipe off the table in case any food or drinks were spilled. I wait for the table in case any food or drinks were spilled to dry and then sometimes spray furniture polish on the table in case any food or drinks were spilled and wipe if off with a dry cloth, so that the table in case any food or drinks were spilled is protected for next time.</text>

    <text>John and Melissa made breakfast on Saturdays for John and Melissa parents because breakfast was John and Melissa day off from school. John's would start by asking John's mom and dad what John and Melissa wanted, and sometimes breakfast was just cereal and toast. But last Saturday, John and Melissa mom and dad wanted the pancakes. So, John and Melissa went into the kitchen, and got a big bowl out of the cupboard. John and Melissa poured the pancake mix into a big bowl, and put in one cup of water, as the directions said on the back of the box. The pancake mix made a nice pancake mix. Next, Melissa went into the refrigerator, and grabbed some blueberries. Melissa put a cup of blueberries into a nice pancake mix, and stirred a nice pancake mix up. John's job was to scoop one whole ladle full of pancake mix and pour one whole ladle full of pancake mix into the griddle. John's was good at pouring the pancakes and making the pancakes round. Once John's cooked the pancakes on the other side, John's would flip the pancakes for the other side to be cooked. Then, John's placed the pancakes on the plates for breakfast. The pancakes were great!</text>

    <text>When I was 16, I asked a girl to go on a date with I. I went up to her after class and I asked her if her wanted to go to a concert with I. I think her liked I and her said yes. I told her when I would pick her up and what we would do, exactly. That night, I went and I picked her up. Her got into I car after I opened her door. We drove to the concert and talked about what we liked to do and what we thought about each other. Most of all, we had fun, especially when we got to the concert. After the concert was over, we went to a ice cream parlor and got some ice cream to share. We laughed at how crazy we were at the concert and decided we should do the concert again. I took her home.</text>

    <text>If I wanted to eat at a fast food restaurant, I would go inside and walk up to the counter. I would look at the wall behind the counter what I wanted where the menu is to see what they have to eat. I would read all of the choices and see which one I thought I would like to eat most. After I decided, I would tell the employee behind the counter what I wanted. I would probably order something like a hamburger, french fries, and something to drink, like a soda. The employee would then tell I how much I meal cost, and I would pay the employee. The employee might give I my food right away, or I might have to wait a few minutes to get my food right away. Once I got my food right away, I would get napkins and ketchup from the counter what I wanted. I would find a table to sit at and would put I tray of food on a table to sit at. I would unwrap my food right away and put a straw in I drink and ketchup on I french fries and enjoy my food right away.</text>

    <text>I went to visit I great uncle the other day, with I son. Uncle Joe is 97 years old. Uncle Joe is still extremely active and shows no signs of slowing down. I son was telling Uncle Joe that Uncle Joe was making Uncle Joe First Communion the next weekend. Uncle Joe stepped into the other room and returned with Uncle Joe rosary. Uncle Joe gave the other room to I son. The other room was Uncle Joe from when Uncle Joe made Uncle Joe first communion. Uncle Joe parents were poor and had saved for a very long time to buy such a nice rosary. I son and I were very touched. As soon as we got home, I son asked if we could write Uncle Joe a thank you letter. I son went and found the nicest stationary my son could fine. My son wrote in my son neatest handwriting and sincerely thanked Uncle Joe. My son drew a heart at the bottom before putting a heart into the envelope, sealing a heart and addressing a heart. Both of those males are so thoughtful.</text>

    <text>My daughter's have birthdays within two months of each other, so every year, instead of presents, we do birthday adventures. This year we planned a mini vacation to a local safari zoo. We spent hours online searching for something fun and interesting to do. My went all over Pinterest searching for something out of the box. We found a zoo two hours south of we that has hands on safari tours. My called a zoo two hours south of us that has hands on safari tours and scheduled a private tour for our girls. After we booked a private tour for our girls, we went online to find local hotels. We went through all the listings and found a suite with a kitchen that we thought would work best for we. We looked up directions on MapQuest to get to the location, and are excited to start we trip this Friday morning. We think we girls will be very happy about visiting a zoo two hours south of us that has hands on safari tours.</text>

    <text>I started I day by going to the home and garden store and buying some vegetables to plant in my garden at home. I bought different herbs, tomato plants, and pepper plants. I drove home and took I purchases outside. I knew exactly where I wanted to add tomato plants in my garden at home. I quickly weeded the space and dug several holes in the dirt for tomato plants. Next, I took each plant out of the container the space came in and put the space in the hole. Then, I covered up the hole. I did this with each plant and when I was finally finished, I watered them really well. I also made sure to add some fertilize tomato plants to help them grow to them fullest potential. Soon, I would have lots of fresh herbs and vegetables. Everyday I would have to make sure to go out and water I plants and of course give them lots of love!</text>

All I really need for supplies is a tent, a lighter, newspaper, some booze, blankets, pillows, phone, flashlight and food. Well, I might also need hygiene products, a fishing pole, extra clothes and towels. I find that making a check list a few days ahead of time will help to remind I of and not forget anything important. Once arriving at the destination, the hardest part is setting up the tent.

We start by warming up before We get into playing with each other. One of We starts by serving the ball to the other person and waiting for a return hit. The ball goes back and forth until someone misses a shot, or the ball goes out of bounds. The person who served gets the points and The person who served gets the ball to serve if the points and the person returning win. Bill has been playing for about 10 years longer than I, so Bill usually ends up winning. I find the game fun and a good way to exercise.</text>

    <text>I was going out with friends last night, and I wanted to take the shower on before I went. The first thing I wanted to do was to wash I hair. I got out of I clothes and turned the water in the shower on. I adjusted the temperature of the water until the temperature of the water was comfortable for I, then I stepped into the shower on. I got I hair wet by standing under the shower head and the water. Once I hair was wet, I reached over to grab a bottle of shampoo, opened a bottle of shampoo, poured some into I hand, then set a bottle of shampoo back down. Then I rubbed the shampoo between both of I hands to work up a little lather. After that, I placed I hands in I hair at I scalp and slowly massaged the shampoo between both of my hands to work up a little lather into I hair and scalp. I worked a little lather down I hair from I roots to I ends. After I hair was fully lathered and clean, I put I head back under the water spray and began rinsing the bubbles and lather from I hair. I used I hands to help push the shampoo between both of my hands to work up a little lather of I hair, and I moved I fingers over the top of I head back to the bottom of I hair to make sure that all of the shampoo between both of my hands to work up a little lather was rinsed out. Once I hair was rinsed, that completed the shampoo out of my hair.</text>

    <text>I needed to write a school report on tigers, and I decided to visit the library to find a book to use in I research. When I entered the library to find a book to use in my research, I saw hundreds of books on many different shelves and was not sure where to find books on tigers. I asked a librarian for help finding books on tigers. Are I looking for stories about tigers, or facts and photographs about tigers? She asked I. I told she I wanted facts and real information so I can write a report. She walked over to a group of shelves labeled Nonfiction and told I that these books all had true facts and pictures, rather than being imaginary stories. True facts and pictures are put in a special order using number codes called the Dewey Decimal System. Using number codes, all the books on tigers would be in the same place and would be very close to books about other animals. She looked up the Dewey Decimal System code for tigers and wrote the Dewey Decimal System code for tigers down for I. Walking through the shelves with I code, I saw that the numbers on the spines of all the books on tigers start at zero and keep getting bigger and bigger. Finally, I was getting close to the number she wrote down for I. There I saw books about lions, cheetahs, and finally tigers. I found a book that looked like it would be helpful for I report and brought a report back to the librarian. She asked I for I library card, and after I handed a report to she, she scanned a report with she computer. Next, she scanned a bar code on the back of a book that looked like it would be helpful for my report and brought it back to the librarian. Now a book that looked like it would be helpful for my report and brought it back to the librarian was checked out in I name so that the library to find a book to use in my research would know who has a book that looked like it would be helpful for my report and brought it back to the librarian. She handed I a book that looked like it would be helpful for my report and brought it back to the librarian and told I that I needed to bring a book that looked like it would be helpful for my report and brought it back to the librarian back to the library in two weeks. If I did n't bring a book that looked like it would be helpful for my report and brought it back to the librarian back, I would have to pay a fine for every day I kept a book that looked like it would be helpful for my report and brought it back to the librarian, because other people might want to read a book that looked like it would be helpful for my report and brought it back to the librarian too. I thanked she and went home to work on I report.</text>

    <text>This morning I made an omelet. I got out a medium-size skillet with sloping sides and put two teaspoons of the butter in a medium-size skillet with sloping sides. I broke four eggs into a mixing bowl. On the cutting board, I chopped two green onions and one Roma tomato. I cut two ounces of cheddar cheese into cubes. I turned on the heat under the hot pan to medium heat and let the butter melt, swirling the heat around to coat the hot pan. I took a whisk out of the drawer and whisked four eggs vigorously until four eggs were light and fluffy. I poured four eggs into the hot pan, and sprinkled the vegetables and cheese over four eggs. When the outer edges of four eggs were firm, I took a spatula and folded an omelet in half. I let a spatula cook until the middle was no longer runny, then slid the middle onto a plate to serve the middle.</text>

    <text>I was traveling on vacation a few months ago, and decided to take a train to I destination instead of flying. I have always wanted to travel by train, and this was a good opportunity. I went online to look at the train schedules. There were quite a lot of the train schedules, so it took I a while to narrow down I choices based on when I wanted to leave and then arrive at my vacation destination. I finally was able to choose a time and date, and I purchased I tickets with I credit card. The day finally arrived to take I vacation. I went to the train station and checked in with the railway. They gave I a paper ticket, which I then brought to the rail line. When we boarded a train, we gave a paper ticket, which I then brought to the rail line to a ticket taker, and he escorted I to I booth. A train was fun and exciting. Finally after all the passengers were on board, we were off. A train seemed a bit jerky in the motion, but eventually a train smoothed out. A train was so much fun, seeing all of the towns and cities we passed through. Some we stopped at and some we just passed through. People would get on and off when we stopped. I was able to purchase some food in my car, which was a bit uncomfortable. I slept some in I car, which was a bit uncomfortable, but I did n't mind. Before I knew a train, we had arrived at my vacation destination. I was really glad that I had taken a train, and was able to see a lot of we beautiful country.</text>

    <text>To make toasted bread, first I take a slice of bread from the package. I plug in I toaster and set the dial to a medium setting, which should give the toasted bread a medium brown color - not too light and not too dark. I put the toasted bread into one of the slots of my toaster and push the lever down. I wait for about 30 to 45 seconds for my toaster to toast the toasted bread. When the toasted bread the toasted bread toasted, the toasted bread pops up from my toaster. I use tongs - wooden or plastic but never metal - to remove the toasted bread from my toaster. If the toasted bread is not dark enough for I, I place the toasted bread back in the slot and toast the bread for another 15 to 20 seconds or so.

    <text>We are going to eat the spaghetti tonight. There will be four of We dining together. The sauce is ready and now The sauce is time to cook the dried pasta into the water. I fill a large pot with the water and place the pot on a stove burner. I turn a stove burner on, all the way to the highest temperature. I add a little salt to the water. When the water begins to boil, I open the box of spaghetti and add the dried pasta into the water to the water. I take a fork and begin to swirl the dried pasta into the water. After a short while, the dried pasta into the water begins to soften. The dried pasta into the water takes about eight minutes to boil the dried pasta into the water. I want to make sure it is just right - not too soft or too hard. So I pull up one strand of spaghetti to test one strand of spaghetti. When one strand of spaghetti is done, I turn off the heat. I take pot holders and carefully lift the pot and bring the pot to the sink. In the sink is a plastic colander. I pour the water and pasta into a plastic colander in order to drain the spaghetti. Now I can serve the dried pasta into the water with sauce on top.</text>

The persons from our group had so many people working, so It did not take time for we turn. We ordered It. The lady rang on The lady machine and total came up with 11.67. I gave I credit card to pay.

But we were not that lucky, because so many people. Finally we got to sit down, and enjoyed we lunch.</text>

    <text>Patty gathered up all the laundry that Patty had strewn around the house during Patty busy school and work week. Patty separated out the whites from all the laundry, making two surprisingly big piles on Patty laundry room floor. Patty got down the new laundry detergent Patty had found for Patty nifty new high efficiency washer. Patty had been so happy with her nifty new high efficiency washer because while Patty did regular laundry in the top, down below Patty could do the white load at the same time. Patty popped two of the new pods in her nifty new high efficiency washer and put the setting for the white load on hold, just putting a little water in the machine. Then Patty put half the white pile into a little water in the machine, leaving a little room at the top. Then Patty loaded her nifty new high efficiency washer with Patty underwear. Patty put the setting back on automatic. Her nifty new high efficiency washer whirred to life and told Patty Patty had 45 minutes before they had to be put in the dryer.</text>

    <text>I had to do dishes because they had been sitting there for a few days. I ran the hot water and turned the cold knob until the hot water was hot but not too hot as to not burn I. I grabbed the sponge and the dish soap and started with the plates since the sponge and the dish soap take up the most room in the dish drainer. I washed each one and placed the sponge and the dish soap in the dish drainer when each was clean. After the plates, I moved on to the glasses and repeated the same pattern. I saved the silverware for last as I always keep one cup to hold the sponge and the dish soap all in. I washed each one individually and put the sponge and the dish soap in the silverware bin in the dish drainer. When I was finished with everything I washed the sink itself to remove the stains left behind by the dishes that had sat there. Finally I cleaned out the strainer in the bottom that was full of food and put everything away.</text>

The older everyone has gotten, the harder it as been to buy gifts. My mom's gift fit nicely in a perfectly square box. Now I just had to wrap it. I got I scissors, tape, and paper out. I rolled the paper out and put the box on the paper out. Next, I made sure that the paper out was going to fit around the box in all directions. After I was sure of this I went ahead and cut the paper out so that I could begin to wrap the paper out. I folded up and taped the top and the two open sides. Next I folded the two open sides into triangles and brought the two open sides up and taped the two open sides on the same side of the box that I had already used tape. It was ready to go!</text>

    <text>I get a small piece of paper and a pencil and decide what I'd like to write down. I write SHOPPING LIST at the top of a small piece of paper and a pencil and underline a small piece of paper and a pencil a few times. I put various things on the list. I put milk, eggs, cheese, bread, bottled water, steak, and watermelon. I fold the paper in half and now I'm ready to get to the store to use the paper in half. I drive there and I'm ready. I unfold I shopping list and see if I forgot to add anything. I do n't think I did. I go into the store with a shopping basket and a shopping list in I hand. I go up and down the different rows looking for what I need to get. I find everything I want to find in the store with a shopping basket and now I'm ready to pay for all the stuff that I bought. I buy them and leave.</text>

    <text>Today in class we are going to be painting a mural for we class graduation ceremony. We teacher wants we to leave we mark for the future generations of students to be inspired. We teacher wanted we to pick we favorite color and to draw or paint anything we wanted on the wall of our classroom. I picked the color pink and decided to draw my favorite flower along with I favorite quote. I am not the best artist but I really wanted to try I best. The wall of our classroom was freshly primed and super white, ready for we to paint on the wall of our classroom. There was about about one hundred and thirty graduates, so we each had a specific time to take we turn to paint. I picked up a small paintbrush and picked up some paint and I started to paint the wall of our classroom. My favorite flower came out as best as I could draw and I wrote I favorite quote. In the end, the wall of our classroom came out beautiful and the wall of our classroom was a good idea.</text>

    <text>I was shopping this past weekend and picked up a new painting that I thought would look great in I living room. When I got home I had to figure out exactly what to move around since I walls are pretty full. I figured out a new way to move pictures around until I had a nice empty spot above I couch. I measured the distance between the two hooks on the back of a new painting and put small marks on the wall the correct distance apart. I got I hammer and pounded the second nail into the first hole. I used a level to make sure the second nail was level with the first. When I got it perfectly level I pounded the second nail in the wall. I lifted up a new painting and lined up the two hooks with the nails and slid a new painting onto the nails. I stepped back and looked to make sure I liked the placement and ensured that the placement looked level. A new painting looks great above I couch!</text>

    <text>I prepared a nice dinner for I family one night, so I wanted to set the dining room table nicely as well. First I laid a red checkered tablecloth across the top of the dining room table. Then I got out five plates from the cupboard, one for each member of I family. I set one plate on the dining room table in front of each chair. Then I got five forks, five knives, and five spoons out from the cupboard. I placed one fork and one knife on the left side of each plate, and then I placed one spoon on the right side of each plate. Then I got five napkins from the pantry, folded five napkins, and placed one on top of each plate. Finally, I went to the cupboard and took out five glasses, poured ice water into five napkins, and set one next to each plate on the dining room table. I family enjoyed the meal.</text>

    <text>This past week, I experienced quite a scare. I was out with friends at a nearby shopping mall. Everything was going just fine. We had went and ate some lunch, and went shopping to some stores We had been wanting to go to. Then, completely out of nowhere, one of I friends suddenly collapsed. I checked the receptionist to see if the receptionist was breathing, but could not feel the receptionist breath or a pulse at all. Panicking, I called 911. After letting the receptionist know I location and the situation, the paramedics informed I that an ambulance was dispatched and would arrive shortly. Sure enough, the paramedics arrived within minutes and carted I friend off on a gurney. I other friends and I wound up going to the hospital that the receptionist was being taken to so We could see the receptionist and be updated on the receptionist condition. Apparently, the receptionist had just fainted, and as it turns out, the receptionist would be discharged from the hospital just one day later.</text>

My friend was about to hit My friend ball when My friend started complaining of being dizzy. My friend put down My friend golf club and sat on the ground, and then My friend vomited. We knew the symptoms of heat stroke and called 911. They instructed We to move My friend to a shady area and to lay My friend down with My friend head propped up. They told We to cool My friend down with water, and try to get My friend to take liquids. We had to watch My friend in case My friend vomited again. We gave They We location and stayed on the phone with They until help arrived. We could hear the sound of the ambulance in the distance.

    <text>I love giving birthday parties to I kids! One of I favorite things is picking out the invitations. I always order the invitations from the same person who does such an amazing job. Once she is done making the invitations I pick the invitations up from she. She provides all the envelopes. I make sure I have stamps before I sit down to start addressing stamps. Once I know I have everything I need, I sit down with I computer and pull up all the addresses. I go through all the addresses writing stamps down on the envelope. Once all the envelopes are addressed, I put the invitations in each of all the envelopes. Once I'm done stuffing all the envelopes with the invitations I seal all the envelopes using a wet towel because I hate licking all the envelopes! I then take out I return address stamp and stamp each envelope with I address at the top left. I then put a stamp on each envelope and put a stamp in the mail to send out to our guest.</text>

    <text>I needed to wash my daughters hair, so I began by detangling my daughters hair with a comb. Once I was sure that my daughters hair was not tangled in any section of my daughters hair, I began to wash my daughters hair by preparing the running water. Using the water faucet, I use both the cold and hot controls of the running water, and continue to adjust hot controls until the running water was warm. Then, I daughter bent over the sink so that my daughters hair could fit under the water faucet. I use the running water to wet my daughters hair, ensuring that all of her hair from front to back was completely submerged under the running water and wet. Once all of my daughters hair was completely soaked in water, I applied a palm full of shampoo to I hand. I use both of I hands to rub them together in order to create suds with the soap and water. Using I hands covered in all the shampoo, I applied the shampoo bubbles to I daughters hair all over. I use I hands to massage the shampoo throughout her entire scalp, and showing to cover each strand of hair with all the shampoo from root to tip, but also ensuring not to pull, tug or yank on my daughters hair in order to prevent breakage. Once all the shampoo had lathered up completely and covered her entire head of hair, we use the lukewarm water to rinse all the shampoo completely from her entire scalp and hair. Ensuring that there was no residue left over size of shampoo, I rinsed my daughters hair for about two minutes moving from front to back and side to side in a repetitive fashion. Once I was satisfied that all the shampoo have been washed out, I applied a palm full of the conditioner to I hand, and rubbing that between the palms of both of I hands. I then applied the conditioner to her hair using both hands, repeating the same process of ensuring that all of the hair strands and scalp was completely covered with the conditioner. I even use a second palm full of conditioner and applied a second coating just to make sure my daughters hair was completely saturated with the conditioner. I spent about five minutes massaging the conditioner into her entire scalp and my daughters hair, giving the hair time to absorb the nutrients that are in the conditioner. After that time period, I placed I daughters head underneath the water faucet again so that the running water could rinse out the conditioner. I use I hands to rob my daughters hair and a downward motion to ensure that all of the conditioner was rents from her scalp and hair, but also laying all my daughters hair and a single direction so that my daughters hair would be easy to perform the next step, which is drying my daughters hair.</text>

    <text>I made the fish last week for dinner. I removed a package of salmon that I had purchased earlier in last week from the fridge. I also removed a small baking dish from the cabinet and preheated the oven. While the oven was heating up, I removed the fish from the oven packaging and put the oven on a plate. I then covered the oven with black pepper, garlic, and butter. I then placed the fish into a small baking dish and waited for the oven to finish preheating. Once adequately heated, I put a small baking dish into the oven and set the timer. Once the timer went off, I pulled out the fish to check and see if the timer was finished baking. Using a fork, I poked the fish to see if the timer would flake apart easily. I noticed that the fish flaked very well throughout, so I turned off the oven and allowed the fish to cool for a few minutes. I then put the fish on a dinner plate to be eaten.</text>

    <text>I was getting hungry, so I prepared dinner to eat. I went into the refrigerator and pulled out the stir fry meal out of the freezer. I then got a pot out of the cabinet, and placed on the stove. I turned the stove on and waited for the stove to warm up. While the stove was warming, I opened the the stir fry bag in order for the food to start thawing. When the stove warmed up, I placed the stir fry in the pan with a little bit of water. After about 10 minutes, the food to start thawing started to thaw. I then got out the bread and the drink. After I did that, I poured in the sauces and more water, and brought the food to start thawing to a boil, I lowered the temperature, and placed a lid on the temperature in order for the temperature to simmer. I toasted the bread and got the ice out of the fridge for the drink. Once the stir fry was done, I placed the food to start thawing on the plate, and placed the food to start thawing on the dining room table with the bread and drink.</text>

    <text>I find that cats are very good about reminding you when it is time for cats to eat. Cats will meow and often stand by cats bowl. I like to feed I cat a mixture of dry and wet food to give her some variety. So the first thing I do is head to the kitchen to see if there is an open can of her food in the refrigerator. If not, then I'll take a can from the kitchen cupboard. Next I'll go to I pantry and pull out a bag of her favorite dry food and mix a little of each into her food bowl. I am careful to measure her food so that her gets just a quarter cup of wet and a quarter cup of dry because I do n't want her to be overweight. Then I'll take the time to make sure her has plenty of water before I set her dish on the floor for her to begin eating.</text>

    <text>I recently went to visit I cousins in San Francisco. I had been looking forward to the trip for awhile because I had not seen my cousins in about two years. I had booked the airline tickets two weeks in advance and just had to go to the airport to head to San Francisco. I went about an hour before boarding and took off in the morning hours. I arrive in San Francisco by noon and was greeted by I uncle, aunt and cousins. We drove to We home where I had a nice lunch. During I visit I went around San Francisco with I family and had a great time just chatting and seeing the sights. In total I stayed around four days. Once it was time to go back home, I had I uncle drop I off at the airport, I had said good bye to everyone before I left. That night I flew back home to Southern California.

    <text>I needed to go to the doctor for a check-up. I made an appointment with the doctor's office and noted the day of my appointment and time of the appointment on I calendar. On the day of my appointment, I drove to the doctor's office and arrived 15 minutes early. I checked in at the front desk and completed some paperwork that was needed prior to I meeting the doctor's. After waiting about 20 minutes, a nurse called I back for I appointment. We went to a small room and a nurse measured I height, weight, and blood pressure. A nurse wrote down the measurements then led I to an exam room and asked I a few questions about I overall health. The doctor's came in a short time later and examined I. The doctor's checked I eyes, ears, mouth, lungs, stomach, and tested I reflexes. The doctor's took notes during I exam and saved notes on a computer. The doctor's said I was healthy and that I could come back in about a year for another check-up. I thanked the doctor's and left the doctor's office.</text>

    <text>Molly's was sitting in Molly's room all alone, frowning to Molly's as Molly's thought about the mistake Molly's made. Molly's was playing with Molly's soccer ball inside, which Molly's was NOT allowed to do and Molly's knew this at the time, but Molly's kicked her soccer ball around inside the house anyway. At one point Molly's went to kick her soccer ball and most unfortunately tripped and fell backwards, accidentally kicking her soccer ball very hard in the wrong direction, causing her soccer ball to hit the coffee table, bounce off the wall and smash into the TV! This knocked the TV off the stand and cause the TV to shatter the screen. Mom and dad were very angry at first, but later explained calmly to Molly that this is why Molly's is n't allowed to play with her soccer ball. Instead of being upset about the incident, Molly's parents got on Molly's parents computer and shopped for a new and much better TV to buy in place of the broken one. All ended up well, and Molly's learned that if Molly's would like to play with Molly's soccer ball, Molly's must go outside first.</text>

    <text>When I was ten I family renovated the kitchen of our house. The kitchen of our house was so interesting to watch the builders work. The builders had many blue prints, that architects had drawn to detail what work had to be done. The builders followed the plans by taking many measurement to make sure the work the builders did was correct. The builders also had new cabinets and floors tiles and appliances. The builders removed some walls while building out others, and laid a new tile floor. The builders installed all the new cabinets and ran the water pipes and electricity to put in all the new appliances we got. The builders had specifically built the cabinets around the fridge and stove so the two appliances slide perfectly into place. It took the builders a few weeks to do but when It was done the kitchen of our house was newer and so beautiful. It had better windows and more lights and It was easy to get around and cook in It. Renovating a room can be fun and really give our house a new look.</text>

    <text>Last week for the first time, I made scrambled eggs and it was a bit nervous for I knowing I had to. But my mom wanted I to so I could learn how to cook, So I decided to get serious and make eggs, my mom wanted to crack the egg open but very softly claiming too hard would mess things up. Following this I had to put the yellow egg yolk in a bowl and my mom told I mix and stir the yellow egg yolk until the yellow egg yolk was completely dissolved into the rest of the liquids. I asked my mom what was next and my mom replied ``Add Salt and Pepper into your mixture ''so I stirred the salt and pepper with the salt as well and then put the salt into the pan on the stove and let the egg fry while I chopped the salt up into small little pieces making I a delicious bowl of scrambled eggs!</text>

    <text>Last week I started feeling sick and ended up getting a sore throat and bad cough. It was very uncomfortable for a few days and the only thing that helped I feel a little better was drinking hot tea. In the pantry in my kitchen I have several boxes of different teas that all come in tea bags. They all have different flavors and smell really good. The first think I did was take a cup out the cabinet in my kitchen and then fill a cup with filtered water from a pitcher I keep handy. I then put the tea bag into the cup for a minute and then put the tea bag in the microwave oven. The tea bag was a big cup so I set the time on the over for 3 minutes on the highest power setting. When hot tea came out hot tea was very hot and I had to be careful when drinking hot tea at first. I left the tea bag in the cup for a minute and stirred hot tea up a little. The I took the tea bag out of the cup for a minute and threw the tea bag away and drank hot tea before the tea bag got too cool. The tea bag made I throat feel better and I stopped coughing for a little bit. I had to keep drinking more throughout the day though until I felt better.</text>

    <text>When it comes to do the things in home by yourself, it needs more preparation than the professionals when they are at work. I was planning to paint the walls in I home. It was kind of stressful to I, especially i did n't want to look like mass. SO I decided to paper the whole room before I start painting. I emptied the whole room before I start painting completely, and then used the papers those I saved when I moved. My home were big so my home was easy to handle and my home were quite sturdy and firm. I started with one side of the wall, and I covered each space by arranging my home next to each other, and overlapping my home, so each space does n't leave any space in between. Then I put the tape where I overlapped my home so while walking on each space, will not move my home from each space space.I made sure that each space was secured on the edges, specially on the area which was close to walls.

    <text>Last time I went to the dentist, I did n't feel like going, but knew that I wanted to honor I appointment. In the morning, I brushed my teeth as I normally do, but I also brushed my teeth right before I went to the appointment. When I got there, I checked in and gave the receptionist I name. Soon after, my teeth called I to the first room, where did my teeth X rays. This was not the most fun thing in the world, but This was n't long and soon after my teeth started to clean my teeth. The process did n't last long, but The process was still annoying. My teeth scraped at my teeth and cleaned my teeth, before finally flossing my teeth. Finally, as the last step, the actual dentist came in and quickly took a look at my teeth before I left. The process was quick and easy and then I got I toothbrush and left.</text>

    <text>I sat with I family in the pew of the First Baptist church in I fancy clothes. I cousin and her boyfriend were getting married, and we were anxiously waiting in the sanctuary of the First Baptist church to watch the ceremony. Finally, elegant music started playing, and I watched as I grandmother was escorted down the aisle of the First Baptist church to a front row seat that had a reserved sign on the First Baptist church. Then the soon to be the Groom grandparents were also escorted down the aisle of the church in the same way. Both the Bride and the Groom came down the aisle next and made there way to the front of the church where a several candles were on display. Groom's parents both lit a tall candle that on both sides of a larger candle called a unity candle. Once groom's parents were seated, the preacher and the groom walked from a side door at the front of the First Baptist church on to the stage. The preacher and the groom took the preacher and the groom place at the middle of the First Baptist church while the Groom stood to the side and nervously stared to the back of the church waiting to see who would be entering next. When elegant music changed, the back doors of the First Baptist church opened and the bridesmaids and groomsmen started walking in pairs slowly down the aisle arm in arm. The bridesmaids and groomsmen dressed in a flowing blue dresses and held a bouquet, and the groomsman were dressed in tuxedos with blue flowers in sticking out of the bridesmaids and groomsmen lapels. The bridesmaids and groomsmen walked to the front of the stage and took the bridesmaids and groomsmen places on each side of the stage. A cute little girl with a basketful of flower petals walked down the aisle sprinkling petals along the pathway. A cute little girl with a basketful of flower petals was adorable, as was the little boy ring bearer, who carried a small pillow with rings tied to the bridesmaids and groomsmen. Elegant music changed again to the Bridal March song. Everyone in the First Baptist church stood and faced the back door of the First Baptist church. As the back doors of the church opened a second time, the bride's stood there in a beautiful white satin sparkly gown and white see through veil that covered the bride's face. The bride's hair was styled in a braided updo and had little flowers peaking out of the bride's braids. The bride's held on to the bride's father's arm as he walked the bride's down the aisle of the church to meet the bride's groom. When they got to the front her father's placed the bride's hand in the grooms and took her father's seat with the bride's mother. The preacher and the groom greeted the people at the First Baptist church and talked to the bride and groom. The preacher and the groom said some nice things about love and asked The couple that caught the bouquet and garter to exchange The couple that caught the bouquet and garter vows. Both the Bride and the Groom took turns repeating things that Both the Bride and the Groom had written about how Both the Bride and the Groom promised to love each other and be faithful forever. The preacher and the groom asked The couple that caught the bouquet and garter at a time if Both the Bride and the Groom wanted to take the other person as the bride's or groom. Both the Bride and the Groom said, ``the Groom do ''. Then Both the Bride and the Groom exchanged wedding rings as a symbol of Both the Bride and the Groom love. The groomsman who was the best man, and the bridesmaid that was the maid of honor had been holding the rings for safe keeping. Once the rings for safe keeping were exchanged, a soft song was played and The couple that caught the bouquet and garter went to light a unity candle. The couple that caught the bouquet and garter each took a unity candle that The couple that caught the bouquet and garter parent had lit, and used a unity candle to light a unity candle in the middle. This represented The couple that caught the bouquet and garter leaving The couple that caught the bouquet and garter parents home and starting a new life together. When a soft song ended the preacher and the groom had The couple that caught the bouquet and garter face the First Baptist church and kiss. Everyone cheered as Everyone were introduced as the newly married Mr. &amp; Mrs Smith. A soft song was a very happy moment followed by a dinner in the reception hall where we watched the couple share cake, have Everyone first dance, and greet Everyone guest. Later the Groom threw a garter to a group of single men, and the bride's threw a bouquet to the single ladies in attendance. The couple that caught the bouquet and garter had The couple that caught the bouquet and garter photo taken together. The bride's and groom then got ready to leave. We all gathered in front of the reception hall with a handful of the bird seed. Someone drove the grooms car up to the sidewalk so that The couple that caught the bouquet and garter could make a quick get away. The groomsmen had decorated the car in funny sayings and balloons. The car in funny sayings and balloons bumper had the streamers. When Both the Bride and the Groom ran to the car, Both the Bride and the Groom threw the bird seed at Both the Bride and the Groom. As Both the Bride and the Groom drove away, the cans on the streamers were dragging and rattling behind. The car's bumper was a fun day that I'm glad Both the Bride and the Groom got to be apart of.</text>

    <text>To get away from hubble and trouble, sometime I take a long drive in I car. The city, I lived is not very congested one. So driving a car is not a big problem. As I daughter always sees a car as a magic. I told her, that a car runs on The gas, as our body works on food as a fuel. The gas is fuel for car. When we burn The gas, car goes ahead. I drove different cars in I life, and all of different cars were either Toyota or Honda. I liked both. I always choose a easy way to reach place when I drive I car, even I have to pass through city. Driving a car sometime bothers I during night time, because can not really see the road signs good. I always prefer driving a car on right lane, unless passing. Always drive on speed designated for area. I love driving I car.</text>

    <text>I noticed that my car was running out of gas on the way home from work. Luckily, I live right by a gas station so I did not need to go out of I way to refuel. A gas station was rush hour, so a gas station was pretty busy. I saw an open pump and pulled up alongside a gas station. I pulled a lever to access the gas cap and stepped out of my car. I walked inside and told the cashier I pump number, and put $20 towards filling up my tank. I walked back through the warm evening air and unscrewed the gas cap. I put the nozzle to the whole and pulled down on a lever. $20 filled up most of my tank, and an open pump made a noise to let I know that an open pump had stopped fueling. I put the nozzle back, screwed in the gas cap, closed the latch, and got back in my car. I drove home, relieved that I now had enough fuel for many days.</text>

    <text>I was ready to change the look of I kitchen, so I decided to put up the wallpaper. I went to a wallpaper store and took about two hours looking through catalogs to decide what I wanted. I ordered the wallpaper and when the wallpaper arrived, I got to work. Fortunately very few tools were necessary. I had a pan to wet the wallpaper, which activated the glue on the back, and a brush to smooth the glue out. First I set a plumb line, which involves a putting a light weight on a piece of string and putting the string in some chalk. I put a plumb line, which involves a putting a light weight on a piece of string and putting the string in some chalk in the center of the first wall I was going to paper to make sure I had a straight line. I put the paper into the water to activate the glue. Then I hung the first strip to be straight down a plumb line, which involves a putting a light weight on a piece of string and putting the string in some chalk. I smoothed out the paper, then repeated with the first strip. I continued to do this until the entire room was papered. The entire room was a full day of work but the entire room looked amazing!</text>

    <text>Sometimes I make a hot dog in the microwave. It's definitely the fastest way to do It. I just put a hot dog in the microwave in the bun, and wrap the whole thing in a paper towel. Then I cook It for a minute and a half on high. When It beeps, It is perfectly cooked and steaming hot. I smear on a spoonful of pickle relish and a line of mustard, and eat up every bite. The trouble is, this way of cooking a hot dog is not reliable. Some brands of hot dogs have cold spots when Some brands of hot dogs're cooked this way of cooking a hot dog. With some brands of bun, the roll will come out overcooked and spoiled. I think different hot dogs and maybe different microwaves do n't work the same way. Different hot dogs and maybe different microwaves means that anyone who wants to make a quick microwave hot dog has to experiment a bit. I did, and I have perfected I technique.</text>

    <text>I was really hungry. I wanted to make something simple and quick. I checked in of the refrigerator and saw there were a few hot dogs left. I took the pack out and put a pan on the stove. I turned on the fire and let a pan get hot. Then I threw a few hot dogs left into a pan. While a few hot dogs left were cooking, I put a couple of hot dog buns on I plate. I kept checking on and rolling a few hot dogs left to make sure a few hot dogs left cooked evenly. When a few hot dogs left were done, I took a few hot dogs left out and put a few hot dogs left in the buns. Then I took the bottle of the mustard out of the refrigerator. I put a line of the mustard on a few hot dogs left. A few hot dogs left looked delicious! I walked over and put the mustard away.

    <text>It had been some time since I changed I bed sheets so I decided It was time. First I went to the bedroom and removed all the pillows from the bed. After removing all the pillows I needed to take off the comforter. Once I had the comforter removed I pulled my bed sheets off the bed. I put my bed sheets in a laundry basket to be washed at a later time. I set a laundry basket by the steps to be taken to the basement so I could put the steps in the washing machine at a later time. I returned to the bedroom and put a fresh fitted sheet on the mattress. I then put the loose sheet and comforter on the bed.

    <text>I was bored one evening and had nothing to do. I thought about watching a movie, but I was not in the mood for any of the movies I owned. I thought maybe I would rent one from a movie store. Most movie stores are gone now though, but you can still rent from a small kiosk in different places. I drove to the nearest store that had a red movie rental kiosk. I thought about which kind of movie I wanted to see. Using the touch screen at a red movie rental kiosk I looked at all the different movies that could be rented. Movies that were sold out at the time were grayed out, and could not be rented. I looked through all the different titles and selected the movie from a slot. A red movie rental kiosk asked I for I credit card and I slid my credit card through the card reader on the side. I entered I zip code and pin number, and finished paying for a movie. A red movie rental kiosk then gave I the movie from a slot, and I took a red movie rental kiosk home to watch. After watching a movie, the next day I went back to the kiosk and dropped a movie off in a slot.</text>

    <text>I wanted to take a photograph of something natural. So I decided to go out side and see what I could take a picture of. After a while I saw a big green pine tree full of birds and squirrels running around. So I wanted the picture to have the big tree as the main subject. I took I camera out of the bag, turned my camera on, and made some adjustments so the light was just right for the photo. I made sure the big tree as the main subject came out, so I stood far back. I turned the flash off because the big tree as the main subject was in the daytime. If the big tree as the main subject was in the night or in a dark place I would use the flash. I looked through the viewfinder on my camera to see how the photo will look and I made sure everything that I wanted to come out did come out. I waited for the right moment and clicked the button, SNAP! The photo was perfect, the photo was just what I had imagined the photo would look like. I made sure to save the photo so that I can print the photo out later.</text>

    <text>The restaurant was terrible again and I probably should not have given The restaurant another chance. The management at the store level is obviously not paying attention to I so The management at the store level is time to right to headquarters. I opened the word processing program on I computer and opened a new document. I went all the way to the right side and entered I street address on one line and the city, state and zip code below that. Next I entered the date and then moved all the way to the left and entered the street address of the restaurant headquarters and the city, state and zip code of the restaurant headquarters. I made the street address of the restaurant headquarters and the city, state and zip code of the headquarters to the attention of the President of Operations by name. I started the letter with Dear Sir and on the next lines, proceeded to explain the problems I had been having with this particular location, this particular location's service and food. I explained that I had tried to resolve the street address of the restaurant headquarters and the city, state and zip code of the headquarters at store level but had been unsuccessful. On the final line, I went all the way to right and entered `Sincerely 'and hit return a couple times, then added my printed name below that.

    <text>Yesterday I made a Mexican Bean Salad for dinner. A Mexican Bean Salad calls for three different kinds of beans -LRB- black beans, kidney beans, and cannellini beans -RRB-, corn kernels, and many other vegetables that required chopping. I got I large cutting board off of the shelf and washed my best sharp knife. I started with half of a red onion. I chopped my best sharp knife up into small pieces. Then I chopped half of a green bell pepper. Next I chopped up a whole red bell pepper. Since a whole red bell pepper was so much smaller than a green bell pepper, I decided to use the whole thing rather than just half. Then I mixed the onion and bell peppers with the beans and corn in a large bowl. Next I made a vinaigrette to pour over a Mexican Bean Salad. The meal was very delicious and I felt healthy and nourished because The meal contained so many fresh vegetables.</text>

    <text>It was time to make dinner. I decided that we would have spaghetti for dinner, because everyone loves dinner. I opened the pantry door. I pulled out a box of the pasta and put a box of pasta on the counter. I grabbed a big jar of spaghetti sauce from the pantry shelf. I put that on the counter. I closed the pantry door and went to the refrigerator to get a package of the ground beef. I set the pantry door on the counter. I put a large frying pan on the stove and turned the heat to medium. I added the ground beef to the pan, crumbling the ground beef into smaller pieces. While the ground beef cooked, I filled a large pot with the water and put a large pot on high heat on another burner. I stirred the ground beef with a wooden spoon while I waited for the water to boil. When the ground beef boiled, I added the long pasta noodles to the water in a large pot. I covered the ground beef almost all the way with a lid, but left a crack so that the water would not overflow. When the ground beef was brown, I turned the heat down to low under the ground beef. I opened a big jar of spaghetti sauce and poured the whole thing over the ground beef. I stirred the sauce into the meat and let the sauce cook for several minutes. I pulled a lid off the long pasta noodles and pulled one out with a fork to see if the long pasta noodles were soft. The long pasta noodles were almost ready, so I got plates out of the dish cupboard and called everyone to dinner. Then I turned off the stove and drained the pasta. I put a serving spoon in the sauce and a large fork in the pasta. Everyone served everyone.</text>

    <text>Recently, I've been getting more and more interested in cooking. In fact, just last week, I decided that I would make spaghetti. Since I parents do n't like spaghetti, though, I only made enough to feed I younger brother and I. The first thing I did was prepare the meat. I cooked some ground beef in the pan for a few minutes, and drained the grease when some ground beef was done. Then, I added the sauce to the meat, and let the sauce simmer in the pan for a few minutes. While this was simmering, I took out a box of uncooked spaghetti noodles and emptied a box of uncooked spaghetti noodles into a separate pot of boiling water. Uncooked spaghetti noodles eventually all became soft, and once I noticed uncooked spaghetti noodles were properly cooked, I emptied a separate pot of boiling water into a strainer. A strainer is a special dish with holes in a strainer, which make sure that the dish catches the hot pasta, and boiling water goes down the drain. Now that both the sauce and pasta were done, I put the hot pasta on plates, poured sauce over the hot pasta, and called I brother over for dinner.</text>

    <text>It was about to be my sister's birthday, and my had picked out the perfect present. My got her a phone case that had lights built into the case, and the case was supposed to be the perfect case to take a picture of the lighting, since the lighting was so good. My was so excited about the gift in the middle that my'd found that my forgot the gift in the middle needed to be wrapped before my could give the gift in the middle to her! My went down into our basement storage room where my family keeps all of our wrapping paper for everyone's birthday and holidays. My picked out some funny wrapping paper with cats on paper since my sister's really loves cats. My sat down on the floor of our basement storage room with my paper, scissors, tape, and my sister's gift, and began wrapping. My cut a piece of paper about three times the size of the gift in the middle and placed the gift in the middle to fold the paper around the gift in the middle. My folded in the ends and taped everything together. My was proud of the job my'd done, since my'd never been very good at wrapping gifts. Finally, my put a pretty pink bow right in the middle of the gift in the middle because that's my sister's favorite color. My sister's loved the wrapping, but my sister's loved my sister's gift even more!</text>

    <text>I did laundry last night after work. Since I live in an apartment I have to go either to a laundromat or use the washing machines in I building which are very small and expensive so I went to the laundromat. Some of I laundry I do not put in the dryer because I prefer to hang the dryer to dry so the dryer does n't shrink. When the rest of I laundry was dry I stuffed the dryer into I bag and basket to fold the dryer at home and not spend any more time than I needed to in the laundromat. When I got home I dumped all I clothes on the bed and put Netflix on TV so watch while I folded. I did n't have a system of what to fold first, I just grab whatever is closest and make piles as I fold. I fold all of I t-shirts so all of my t-shirts can be lined up in my drawer that I can see the design on every shirt rather than putting all of my t-shirts in a pile. I pants get folded in half and then over again so all of my t-shirts are in a square and fit nicely in the drawer. I fold I underwear in half and then in half again. I socks I do n't fold, I just put all of my t-shirts in a pile by matching pair and lay all of my t-shirts in my drawer. Sweatshirts get hung up in the closet. I took I time since I was watching Netflix while I was doing Netflix.</text>

    <text>As a child, I loved taking baths. I mother always had to fill the tub for me so that the water would not be too hot or too cold. I'd say that the ideal temperature for the water was about 90 degrees. I favorite part of taking a bath was the bubbles. I loved to splash around the tub for me and play with the bubbles. Once I sat in the tub for me, I used shampoo to wash I hair and a washed I body with a soapy washcloth. I made sure to wash behind I ears and on I face as well. Once I was clean, I would play with I bath toys for a little while. After some time has passed, I drained the water. After draining the water, I would stand up and dry I off with a towel.

    <text>I decided to bake a cake the other day. I took a look around I kitchen and I had everything I needed, so I did n't need to go to the store. I pulled up a recipe on I tablet and started collecting the dry ingredients like flour and sugar. Once I had everything on the counter, I looked at what measures I would need and got out the cups and teaspoons and all the bowls I'd need to mix the cups and teaspoons in. I started by measuring out the dry ingredients like flour and sugar and put the dry ingredients like flour and sugar in the bowl. Then I added things like the eggs and milk and mixed it all up using I electric mixer. About halfway through I turned the oven on to preheat. I finished mixing everything and got everything into the cake pan. I set a timer and stated putting the dirty dished in the sink to wash. I decided that they would keep for a little while and waited until later that night. When a cake was done I let a cake cool off and put chocolate frosting on a cake. Everyone agreed a cake was a really good cake, and washing the dishes was n't that hard. I think I'll bake a little more often.</text>

    <text>John's dad orders the newspaper to come to John's house every day. It is delivered by the newspaper man, who delivers the newspaper every afternoon. Today like normal, the newspaper man, who delivers the newspaper every afternoon arrived around 1pm and delivered the newspaper by putting the newspaper into the mailbox just for the newspaper. The newspaper is right next to the regular mailbox. After school, John's hops off the school bus, and checks the mail for his dad, and also checks for the newspaper. John's gets the mail, and the newspaper, and brings the mail to the house. John's loves to do this for his dad because John's knows his dad is busy, and this for his dad is a sweet thing for John's to do for his dad. His dad comes home at night after work, and sits down in John's favorite chair, and checks the mail that John's left for John's on the table. John's then reads John's newspaper and drinks John's coffee. Then his dad gives John's a big bear hug and kiss, telling John's thank you for the mail and newspaper.</text>

    <text>As I was about to start dinner I realized I had n't unloaded the dishwasher yet and I needed clean plates for I upcoming meal. I opened up the dishwasher yet and began taking the clean dishes out. I started with the top shelf of the dishwasher yet because the clean cups and glasses are always the easiest items for I to remove. I removed each clean glass and cup one by one and carefully put them neatly stacked in the kitchen cabinet above I head. I walked over to the cabinet I store I pots and pans in and opened it up for easy access and began unloading I big cooking pots that I had used the night before to cook with. Once I got my big cooking pots, I carefully removed the rest of the dishes in the dishwasher, which only included a few plates and utensils to be put away in varies locations around the kitchen.

    <text>The day can not begin without good tea. As I finished I morning routine, I went to kitchen to make a cup of tea for I. I grabbed small pan which can hold 2 cup of the water. I turned a stove on high heat, because a stove was just water that I am going to boil. I added the water in pan and put the water on stove. When the water started to boil I put some cinnamon for flavor, and 2 teaspoon of loose tea. I prefer loose tea which is made on the stove. I let the tea boil for at least 5 minutes.

A community theater production of ``Man of La Mancha ''was held at a very nice modern theater that is part of a community center in a nearby town. My enjoy the music in ``Man of La Mancha ''very much. My found out about a community theater production of ``Man of La Mancha ''. The play started at 8:00 p.m. and since there were no reserved seats, we left early. We drove in the car on the way home to the theater. We arrived at 7:30. We purchased we tickets at the box office. They gave we a program which contained a lot of information about The play, the actors and production crew, and the community theater company in general. We read that program until The play started. When the house lights went down in the ``house ''-LRB- which is what the house lights call the audience part of the theater, where you sit -RRB-, an orchestra began to play. An orchestra was on the floor below the stage and immediately in front. The music at the beginning is called ``the overture. '' The house lights played the overture for about five minutes. Then the stage curtain went up and The play began. The stage curtain consisted of several acts, and at least a dozen songs. There was some dancing, and as the stage curtain was a play about Don Quixote and Sancho Panza, the two main characters rode ``pretend ''horses which were like boxes around the two main characters waists but you could see the two main characters legs underneath. ``Man of La Mancha ''is a funny story with a sad ending because Don Quixote -LRB- really the author Miguel de Cervantes -RRB- goes to prison. There was an intermission in the middle of the performance where they stopped the action, put the house lights on in the ``house ''-LRB- where the audience sits -RRB-, and we went out into the lobby of a very nice modern theater that is part of a community center in a nearby town to buy a Coke. After intermission, we went back into a very nice modern theater that is part of a community center in a nearby town to see the rest of The play. We knew The play was over when the stage curtain was lowered for the final time. The stage curtain did go up again, one more time, as the actors came out onstage and we applauded the actors. We had also applauded the actors after every song during The play. Then the house lights went up for the final time, we left a very nice modern theater that is part of a community center in a nearby town, got into the car on the way home and went home. In the car on the way home we talked about how much we liked the songs.</text>

    <text>I start by opening the dish washer and pull out the top rack so I can start putting away the cups and plastic bowls. There are many cup on the top rack, some are glass and some are plastic. The cups are the important parts of dish washing so you know you do not melt plastic! Once I am done with the top shelf I go to the bottom where the plates and pans are. The cups are where the really dirty dishes go. But, you would never put plastic cups on the top rack because the top rack would damage the cups and the machine. Once the top rack is done, I start on the silverware. I put each item in the correct slot in the drawer, knives, spoons and forks all have a special place. There are also some cooking utensils that have to be put away, some are in the silverware area and some are on the top shelf.

Next I removed the flat sheet, making sure I pulled the flat sheet completely off. Finally, I removed the fitted sheet. I decided I wanted to wash fresh, clean sheets on my bed too. Nothings better than feeling soft new sheets on your pillow when your go to sleep! Once I pulled off all of the sheets, I placed all of the sheets in I laundry basket. Just as I was about to start putting on fresh, clean sheets on my bed I had taken out of I closet; I dog, Waldo, jumped up on my bed! Before I could put the new fitted sheet on my bed I had to pick up Waldo and put Waldo on the floor. After that was done, I pulled I purple fitted sheet over each corner of my bed. I made sure all four corners were completely covered. I even pulled the ends of the flat sheet under my bed, to make sure they would n't come loose! Next, I took the flat sheet and spread the flat sheet across my bed. At the foot of my bed I made sure to tuck in the corners of the flat sheet, so the flat sheet would n't come off in the night. Finally I a pillow in each one of I pillow sheets, and placed them onto of the bed. The only thing left to do was to put the quilt off of my bed on top! After that was finished, I made sure everything was neat and tidy and that the quilt off of my bed was on straight! Finally I could go to sleep!</text>

    <text>Yesterday I went to a sauna with my friend. Yesterday was a Korean spa that is very popular. We checked in at the desk and confirmed We reservation. We were given robes and slippers to change in. We changed in the locker room and stored We belongings. The robes were very comfortable and cozy. We then relaxed at the spa and went into the hot tub. The spa was very refreshing. Afterwards, We checked out the masseuse to get a foot massage. We moved on to the sauna and stayed there for a couple of hours. We ended up falling asleep at the sauna and taking a quick nap. When We woke up, We were hungry so We got a bite to eat at their indoor Korean restaurant. We bought some Korean short ribs, rice, and some beef cubes. We really enjoyed We and plan to return go back again soon.</text>

    <text>I woke up early on Monday because I mother was coming over for dinner and the place was a mess! I knew I had to straighten up or she would be disappointed in I. I started by picking up all the clothes that were on the floor and furniture. I threw all the clothes that were on the floor and furniture in a hamper and carried all the clothes that were on the floor and furniture down the hall to the laundry room where I started all the clothes that were on the floor and furniture in the washer. Then I ran around the flat collecting dirty dishes. I loaded all the clothes that were on the floor and furniture into the dishwasher and pressed a button to make the dishwasher start. I looked around the living room. Still a mess! I pulled a trash bag out of the cabinet and collected all the paper, junk mail, and old food cartons and soda bottles that I had left out. I filled a trash bag and set a trash bag near the door to take outside later. When my dog barked, I remembered that I should vacuum as well to get rid of the fur all over the carpet. My dog did n't like the vacuum! When I was done with that, I took the trash to the outside can and came back inside. The flat was clean!</text>

    <text>I bought seeds a few weeks ago from a gardening center. I only got the basics, a few types of tomatoes, cucumber, lettuce, and peppers. Tomatoes grow really well in I climate but peppers are hit or miss. I turned the earth by hand several times over a week, picking out weeds, roots and rocks each time. Eventually the earth was soft and aerated close to 10 inches down. I raked the dirt one last time and lined the edges with stone. I made rows of dirt for each vegetable and small mounds for the cucumbers. I poked holes where each seed would be planted following the depth and spacing guidelines on the seed packets. I then dropped one seed into the corresponding hole for each row and covered one seed over. I lightly watered the whole garden, stepped back and imagined what the whole garden would look like three months from now.</text>

    <text>The entire omelette is a delicious breakfast meal that uses beaten eggs cooked in a pan with a filling of vegetables that are added during cooking. To start, I like to gather all of I ingredients and have all of my ingredients ready. I need two eggs, two tablespoons of milk, a 1/4 teaspoon of salt, a dash of pepper, and a 1/2 cup of filling that includes shredded cheese, chopped spinach and onion, and cubed ham chunks. Next, I beat the eggs, milk, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl. I beat salt until salt's mixed really well. I heat the butter in pan until the butter melts, and then I pour in the egg mixture. The butter cooks really quickly, so I have watch closely. Once the egg starts to thicken, I add in the filling to one half of the entire omelette. Then I use a spatula to flip over the other half, covering a filling of vegetables that are added during cooking. I cook that for about a minute, and then flip over the entire omelette and cook briefly on the other side. Then, I slide the entire omelette onto a plate and I'm ready to eat.</text>

    <text>I decided I wanted to take a vacation, so I needed to plan for my holiday trip. I was n't sure where I wanted to go, so first I wrote down a list of 4 different places I wanted to go, a trip to Las Vegas, a trip to the beach, a camping trip, and a trip to Puerto Vallarta in Mexico. Next I narrowed down I choices, I could n't afford to go to Mexico, or to Las Vegas. That left a beach trip or a camping trip. I decided I wanted to go to the beach to enjoy the sun. I thought about getting a plane ticket, but the beach was close enough to I house that I could drive and save some money. I looked on the internet to find a hotel near the beach that I could afford. I planned to stay three days, but I found a hotel that was less expensive so I could afford to stay for five days. Finally, I packed I bag with beach clothes and towels, and set off on my holiday trip.</text>

    <text>One of my favorite hobbies is playing tennis. When my play tennis, a friend and my go to a special place called a court, which is made just for playing tennis. The tennis court is a flat place with a net across the middle. To play tennis, we hit a ball back and forth at each other using big net paddles called rackets. If you do n't hit a ball back when a ball's hit to you, or if you opponent hits a ball so a ball goes outside of the court, you score points. Scoring in tennis is very different than in other sports. When you score once, you get fifteen points. When you score again, you get another fifteen points, so you have 30 points. Score a third time, you get 10 points, giving you a total of 40. If you score again when you have 40 points, you win the whole game!</text>

Then, you want to twist off the current light bulb and throw the current light bulb out and twist on the current light bulb. Upon doing this, the current light bulb is important to make sure that the current light bulb is tight on the light fixture. After making sure that the current light bulb is, you should try to turn on the light and see if the light works. If the light does work, you can be sure that you put the current light bulb in properly. Then you may try the current light bulb a few times, but you should feel comfortable that the light works well. You may stop you work and throw out the current light bulb.</text>

    <text>I called I tennis buddy and we agreed that we wanted to play tennis the next day. He called the courts to make reservations for a couple hours. We both met at the courts and we warmed up for a while and then we played a match. When our time was finished, we quit and had a cold drink court side. Our time was a great time for both of we and we completed we objective of fun and exercise. We left the court after having a few drinks and talking about we lives. We both agreed that we would try to make this a weekly happening and we decided to leave. Before leaving we had to pay for the court.

    <text>I take our laundry basket out of the bathroom and take our laundry basket to our laundry room. Our laundry basket is near full, so I put the dial on our washing machine to start the water flowing. I pull the knob on our washing machine to start the water flowing. Next, I measure out the laundry detergent and pour into our washing machine to start the water flowing tub. The laundry detergent mixes with the water flowing. I then start to put the wet, clean clothing into our washing machine to start the water flowing. When I have finished loading our washing machine to start the water flowing, I close the lid. Our washing machine to start the water flowing wets the clothes with the laundry detergent, mixes the wet, clean clothing around, and then rinses the clothes off with clean water. Nearly a half hour later, the washing machine stops. To finish the process, I open the lid and put the wet, clean clothing into our dryer. I place a dryer sheet in the dryer with the clothes to prevent static. An hour later, the clothes are clean and dry.</text>

    <text>I was spending some time with I friends at the beach and the beach was starting to get cold. Since we wished to stay for a while yet, we decided that we wanted to build a bonfire. I friends and I set out to explore the forest area near the beach and see what we could find in order to create a bonfire. We gathered a bunch of twigs and branches, since we would be good kindling for the fire. We also picked up a bunch of newspapers and other assorted paper items that people had left lying around. We then headed into the forest area near the beach and picked up a bunch of leaves and scattered plant remnants. We carried all of these items back to the place where we had set up we chairs and other gear and then we assembled other gear all into a large pile. I friend doused other gear all with some lighter fluid and, being careful to stand back from a large pile, we tossed a match onto a large pile. A large pile flared up and burned brightly, creating a nice, warm fire for all of we to enjoy.</text>

    <text>The first time I took a bath, I enjoyed a bath so much that I did not want to stop. A bath felt like I was sitting in a pool of the warm water. I was a young kid so a bath was a bubble bath and I had some toys to play with. Either I mother or I father would wash my own hair for I then they would help I wash the remainder of I body. But they just told I not to splash the warm water and to keep the water in all clean in the bath tub. I would play with I toys and get all clean in the bath tub. After a few years I learned how to wash my own hair and I would prefer to take a bath over a shower since a bath was more fun to sit and relax in the warm water and enjoy a fun evening. From the best of I memory, I remember that I always loved taking a bath. Then when I am done in all clean in the bath tub, I would get out and wrap up in a huge dry cotton towel and dry off!</text>

    <text>I did the laundry for I wife and I last week. When I was finished with the laundry, I would put the laundry in the hamper and take the laundry back to our house. After getting home, the laundry would be time to fold the laundry. I poured all of the clothes out onto the bed. After I did that, I got each piece of clothing and started to fold each piece of clothing. I would tuck the arms of the t-shirts behind the body of the shirt and fold the pants in half. To stay organized, I put the pants in the piles after being folded so the pants would be easy to put away. When the pants were folded into piles, I would make sure I was n't missing anything.

    <text>I have to clean the shower today. I gather up all I supplies: A sponge, bleach tile cleaner, a foaming cleaner for the faucet and shower head and ceramic shelves. I remove all the items from ceramic shelves, including soap, shampoo and any other bottles. I place all the items next to the shower. Next I spray the faucet, shower head, and shelves with the foaming cleaning spray. I let that soak in for awhile. Then I spray the tile and glass door with the bleach cleaner. This disinfects the surfaces, and also removes any mildew. I let that soak in. I take I sponge and wipe down the faucet, shower head and shelves. Then I rinse I sponge and wipe the faucet, shower head and shelves again to remove the foaming cleaning spray. Next I scrub the door and the tile with I sponge, making sure to remove any mildew or built up soap scum. I rinse I sponge again and wipe the door and tile one more time to make sure the bleach is removed. Next I will run the shower and splash water on the surfaces, to double check that all the cleaning sprays are thoroughly rinsed off. Now I shower is clean.</text>

    <text>I noticed today that my lawn was getting rather shabby. My lawn looked awful, especially when my lawn was compared to that of I next door neighbor's. I went into my garage where I kept my lawn mower. I tried to start my lawn mower, but my lawn mower would n't work! I had all the gas. I drove down to the gas station on the corner and bought a couple of gallons of gas for my lawn mower. After paying for all the gas, I put the tank of my lawn mower back into the bed of I truck. Then, I drove home. I poured all the gas into the tank of my lawn mower. Then I climbed into the seat. I turned the key and the seat started! I zoomed around I yard, happily clipping I unsightly grass. Afterward, I rolled my lawn mower back into my garage and turned my garage off. Then, I took the key from the ignition and hung the key on the rack. My unsightly grass looked great!</text>

    <text>We are renovating our whole home since We purchased our whole home a month ago. I told I husband that I wanted to buy a upper, so We could put We own mark on the whole house. The task has been difficult but We have had fun accomplishing each task. This week We have to lay down all the floors in the whole house. I hired a contractor to do all the flooring in our whole home. We had everything taken out of the rooms and all the old carpet was stripped. I picked a beautiful maple wood flooring to go in the whole house. The contractors have been hard at work for a couple of days, installing each plank of wood at a time. After the floor is laid out in one room, The contractors cover the floor with brown paper and start another room. The loud banging of all the floors in our house can be heard throughout the whole house. After a few days, The contractors finished all the floors in our house and The loud banging of the floors being installed came out just as I imagined.</text>

    <text>The cashier had just finished eating my lunch and knew my lunch was time to go my grocery shopping for the week. The cashier always buy my groceries all at one time for the week and then cook everything over the weekend so that the cashier do n't have to cook on a daily basis. Anyway, the cashier hopped in my car and drove to Walmart which is where the cashier usually do all my grocery shopping. The cashier found a parking space close to the entrance because the cashier knew the cashier was going to buy a lot. The cashier got out of my car, walked through the store doors, and grabbed a shopping cart along the way. The cashier made the cashier way down the fruit and vegetable aisles first, picking up bananas, oranges, salad mix, and kale along the way. The cashier then added some fish, chicken, hamburger meat, and pork to the cashier cart. Moving along down the aisles, the cashier picked up all the dairy goods, spices, and snacks the cashier would need for the week. With a shopping cart stacked high, the cashier headed to the check out line where the cashier greeted the cashier warmly and began ringing the cashier items up. My total came to $101.43 which was a lot of money but definitely worth My total. The cashier bagged my groceries as the cashier paid. Then, the cashier pushed my cart full of groceries out of the store and to the parking lot where the cashier would load groceries into the cashier trunk. The cashier put a shopping cart and drove away.</text>

    <text>When I go grocery shopping I almost always take a list. So for I, the first step to shopping is list making. I list what I plan to cook this week, and also cleaning products and similar things. I favorite place to shop is a huge membership store, for My favorite place to shop good prices. I pick up a shopping cart just outside the store. Then I enter, sometimes showing I membership card to the person at the door and sometimes getting in without showing the door. I cruise past the impulse items just inside the door, and through the electronics and organic foods sections that come next. Next come many aisles with items like light bulbs and pillows. Finally I get to the food. There are usually people here offering samples of new food items. I often take some. I buy large packages of chicken or fish that can be frozen. Sometimes I buy fresh bread. I continue to the fresh fruit and vegetable section, where I try to restrain I to what I can use. Next come the chiller and frozen foods, but I go past hem to pet food and paper goods. I get frozen food on the way back, and then a few canned food and dry goods. The last areas are pharmacy, which I mostly avoid, and the book section, where I'm apt to linger. Then I wait in line for a while, pay, and leave the store. As I leave, someone checks I cart, to make sure what's on I receipt matches the huge load I am carting home.</text>

    <text>I am sitting on the couch eating chips. Soon, I am done with the garbage bag so I walk to the kitchen, open the lid of my garbage can, and put the couch eating chips inside. The garbage bag barely fits because my garbage can is overflowing. I push the items on top further down, so that everything can fit. I realize it is time to take of the trash. I pull on the two colored drawstrings on each side of the garbage bag and close the garbage bag.

    <text>My wife and My had been living in this flat down on Main Street for about eight years. We were not the best of housekeepers while were there. It was a tiny one bedroom, one bathroom apartment with a small kitchen, dining room and a decent sized living room. There was only one closet, a very large walk-in closet in a tiny one bedroom. Put simply, there just was not enough storage space, so everything ended up piling up on the floor. Laundry, both clean and dirty ended up in a basket or on the floor because there was no room in only one closet, a very large walk-in closet in the bedroom. When We moved out We spent two or three days cleaning the place. Cleaning is n't that hard, the place's just determination. So, We each picked an area of one bathroom apartment with a small kitchen and just started. We threw away everything We could live without and stuffed clothes in to garbage bags to take clothes to the laundry mat. We scrubbed dishes and put clothes away and then scrubbed down the counters once everything was off of clothes. We shared the worst job in the place, cleaning the bathroom.</text>

    <text>The last time that I changed I bed sheets, I remember my bed sheets smelling somewhat gross and being half off I bed.

After putting detergent on my bed sheets, I set the washer to begin and started washing my bed sheets. Soon after, I put my bed sheets in the dryer and then took my bed sheets back upstairs. At this point, I was able to put my bed sheets back onto I bed and make sure that my bed sheets were on tight. When I smelled I bed, everything smelled fresh and clean and I also felt refreshed. My bed sheets was an enjoyable experience for I.</text>

    <text>Every morning I like to make I bed since I got a new quilt and the shammed pillows for I bed. I do a new quilt the easiest way I can because I really hate making a bed. I pull the sheet with the quilt together and flip the sheet over a little bit, so the sheet shows the sheet. I then make sure the shammed pillows are looking even and fluffy. I put the decorative pillows. I then take the decorative pillows that I have and lean the decorative pillows up against the shammed pillows in the middle. Making sure it all looks good and even. I make sure that the fluffy blanket I keep on the foot of I bed is nicely folded. The fluffy blanket I keep on the foot of my bed matches the decorative pillows I put on I bed.

We spent several minutes looking at all of the movies. We read the back of several empty cases to figure out what each movie was about. My ended up choosing a romantic comedy and My husband chose a sci-fi fantasy movie. We carried the empty display cases to the circulation desk, where the worker was sitting. We gave him our library card, which he scanned prior to scanning each movie.

    <text>Yesterday, I stopped at a fast food restaurant with I family. We had to decide whether to go through the drive-thru or to eat in a fast food restaurant.

    <text>Yesterday I went to visit my mother. Since my am 56, my mother is very old, my sister Brenda is 76. It is easier to just go visit my sister Brenda at home than to go somewhere together and do things. It is important for my to remember to visit with all my older relatives, because since all my older relatives do n't get out often, all my older relatives sometimes become lonely. So my try to take something for all my older relatives so that after the visit is over, all my older relatives will still have something to remind all my older relatives my was there. My wanted to take flowers from my garden to plant at my sister Brenda house, but it was too hot to do garden work because the temperature was 95 degrees out. So instead my took my sister Brenda a case of my sister Brenda favorite soda to drink every day so the temperature would remind my sister Brenda of my, and cool my sister Brenda off from the heat. My sister Brenda lives an hour away from my, and the temperature is a long drive. My was tired when my got there, so we just sat outside on my sister Brenda porch and drank sodas. My talked about lots of stories of people we both know from when my was younger. Older people like to be reminded of stories of things that happened long ago, so my told my sister Brenda about how my sister Brenda had once made my grandma laugh when my sister Brenda bought everyone in the family cheap little silly presents for Christmas. My said my grandma thought it was so thoughtful of my little sister to want to make sure everyone got a present, even if it was something little and cheap and silly. Somehow, talking about Christmas and drinking a cold soda made we suddenly not feel so hot in the 95 degree weather. My said goodbye and promised to visit this weekend, and the drive home did n't seem to take so long because my kept smiling thinking about the stories we told.</text>

    <text>Roger was nervous, and for good reason. Roger was taking a driver lesson in a big car. Roger had never tried to do a three point turn in a large car like a driver lesson in a big car. A three point turn in a large car like that was a truck, Roger dad's truck. So, when Roger got there, Roger asked Roger to buckle up, and Roger drove off in the truck going regular speed. Roger asked Roger to do several things, like take a turn left, turn blinkers on, stop, go, change lanes, all these things. Roger had to do each thing carefully, while was checking for other cars around Roger. Roger made sure Roger did not go too fast, and Roger did do all Roger turns well. Roger did not hit any other cars. The one thing Roger did not do was turn off the lights at the end of the test. Roger got back into a big car and turned off the lights, and then locked a big car in the end of the test. Roger was happy with Roger driving and passed Roger.</text>

I then strain the teabags -LRB- even though you're not supposed to -RRB- and drop 3 vitamin C tablets and a teaspoon of lime juice. I add a teaspoon of wheat grass and a teaspoon of turmeric and other spices. I also add 5-15 mg of yohimbine as well as some branched chain amino acids. I stir this all up and then sip on this and take I vitamins. I continue to drink I tea while I read news articles and scroll through Facebook for about an hour before I hour long workout. If this is a more relaxed day I will drink earl grey with cream and honey.</text>

    <text>Christmas is just about the only time of year I wrap gifts. The rest of the year I just use bags or give gift cards. But because I buy gifts for children at Christmas, I like to wrap children at Christmas so children at Christmas have the fun of opening children at Christmas. In order to wrap a gift I first eyeball how big the package is. Then I pull out that amount of paper from the roll and cut the roll with scissors. Then I fold the paper around a gift. I'm not very neat with the paper around the gift because the kids do n't care and are just going to tear the paper around the gift all apart anyway. Then I take tape and tape the edges off. Sometimes I get fancy with the folding of the paper around the gift, but usually not. I then repeat this process for all of the other gifts. If I'm feeling particularly generous I'll throw a bow on top of a gift too, with a card as well.</text>

    <text>I love taking baths! They are so relaxing after a long day. When I get home from work, often, the first thing I do is start to fill the bathtub. I set the water temperature to a nice warm setting. While the tub out is filling, I will gather two fluffy towels and a face cloth. I also pour I a glass of ice water to sip on while I'm soaking. I go and grab the latest magazine that I've been waiting to read and put the latest magazine next to the tub. Once the tub out is filled, I climb in. I start by washing I face and then I hair. After I hair is washed, I put a deep conditioner in I hair. Now, then my hair's time to relax. I let a deep conditioner sit while I read I magazine and sip some water. After 15 minutes, I rinse I hair out and then wash I body with soap. I rinse off and then give I a few more minutes of soaking before I empty the tub out. After I dry off, I rinse the tub out to make sure that I leave the tub clean and shiny for the next time I use the tub out.</text>

    <text>I walked up to the sink and it was full of dishes from last night and this morning. I really needed to get these into the dishwasher. I turned on the hot water an felt around for its temperature. Turned on the hot water an felt around for its temperature to get its to the right temperature. Then I wetted my sponge with some soap on my sponge and started scrubbing some of the gunk off the dishes. My sponge makes you wonder why we do this before loading the dishwasher. The entire point of having a dishwasher is to wash dishes. But I'm washing the dishes. I should be able to just load the dishwasher with dirty dishes with all the gunk on the dishwasher, and the dishwasher should wash dirty dishes clean. That's the whole point of the dishwasher. But That's not going to work. Because the jets of water is n't strong enough to clean dried up gunk off the dishes. I've loaded the dishes into the washer, and put some soap in the washer, and closed the door and hit the clean cycle. I have to take the dishes out once the dishes're finished and dried.</text>

    <text>This past Saturday I went to the beach. It is only about 20 minutes from I house and on Lake Ontario, which is one of the Great Lakes. I took I toddler, Alex with I, we brought along some toys, snacks, and sunscreen, and off we went. The temperature was in the eighties, and The temperature was bright and sunny, but being so far north, the water was too cold to swim in. We decided to play in the sand instead. Together we built a large sandcastle with a moat that allowed water to flow in. We threw a ball back and forth, watched boats, and ate some snacks. After we went for a walk on the long pier at the beach, Alex rode nicely in Alex stroller. By that time, we got tired out, went home, and took a nice, long nap. We have a great time whenever we go to the beach.</text>

Once I arrived at the final destination, I took a shuttle to the correct hotel. I got some dinner and went to bed early. The next morning I was up very early in order to prepare for the day. I got dressed and did I hair. I called some cousins to ask what time some cousins would arrive. I planned to meet some cousins at the church. When I arrived, I gave everyone hugs, and talked in the hushed tones reserved for funerals. I went to the graveside services after the funeral, and placed a rose on the casket at the end, and watched as the funeral was lowered into the ground. I went to the church for a lunch when this was complete.</text>

    <text>I look in the refrigerator to see what I will make for dinner. I see that I have chicken thighs, so I take chicken thighs out of the refrigerator to see what I will make for dinner. I look at I recipe book to see what I should do with chicken thighs. Then I turn on the microwave oven to preheat the microwave oven. I spray a baking dish with cooking oil, then put the four chicken thighs in a baking dish with cooking oil. I select some different spices and sprinkle some different spices on top of the chicken: salt, oregano, and thyme. The oven beeps when it has preheated to the right temperature, and I put the chicken in without covering the chicken. I turn on a timer for a half hour. Now I have to decide what to serve with the chicken. Potatoes? I take some red potatoes out and wash some red potatoes in the sink. I poke holes in some red potatoes with a knife and then put some red potatoes in the microwave oven. I cook some red potatoes for about ten minutes overall, but I wait so that some red potatoes're finished when the chicken is ready, after a half hour in the microwave oven. When the alarm I'd set goes off, I take the chicken out and take some red potatoes out. The food is ready to go on a plate. I'll add butter and salt to the potatoes to make some red potatoes delicious.</text>

    <text>I came home from school after a long hectic day. Our gym teacher made Our go 10 laps around the school track. I was totally exhausted by the time I came home. I wanted nothing more than have a hearty lunch and sleep till the evening. When I came home mom was n't there. That meant only one thing, a hearty lunch was already made and sitting cold on the kitchen counter. Usually when mom does this a hearty lunch's not much of a bother, I just load up the stuff in a microwave bowl and heat that up in seconds. But Our microwave has been broken for more than a week now. I would have to heat that food on the gas. I open up the jar to see what's for lunch today. The jar to see what's for lunch today's spaghetti and meatballs. I grab a wok from the kitchen rack and poured the contents of jar in the kitchen rack. The kitchen rack would have taken I 30 seconds in microwave to heat all of that but now I spent 5 minutes on the gas. Finally after five minutes I able to devour that pasta and go to bed for I afternoon nap.</text>

    <text>Every morning I am the first to wake up in I family-even if I wanted to sleep in, I just ca n't do it. The first thing I need is coffee. I stumble out to the kitchen and add the grounds to the machine and pour in some water. After the coffee is brewed and in I cup I have to add to the coffee. I can not drink I coffee straight yet, I have to add some sweet things to take away the bitter taste. So I add a small amount of milk and about two teaspoons of sugar. I mix it all up really well and then just let it sit for a minute. It is too hot to drink right after it has been brewed. After a few minutes I sit down to enjoy the quiet of the house before everyone wakes up, with I nice, fresh cup of coffee.</text>

    <text>When I last planned a trip, I thought about the kind of things that I wanted in vacation. I realized that I wanted to relax, but also wanted to have an array of activities and restaurants to chose from. Keeping in mind that it was the holiday season where it is cold here, I decided to go to Florida. I first talked to I sister and parents about going and then looked online for many days for cheap airfare. Upon finally finding some, I booked cheap airfare and remained excited about a trip. I selected our seats and paid for our bags at that moment as well. I then made a list of what I wanted to do and see while there and what was open and what was closed. I tried to develop a plan, but also wanted some of a plan to be relaxing and unstructured. Consequently, I did not plan everything.</text>

    <text>I recently got a flat bicycle tire while riding home from work. As soon as I got home, I removed a flat bicycle tire from the bike and checked for the cause. Sure enough, there was a small puncture, I must have run over something sharp while commuting home. I then went to the local bike shop and the man at the shop recommended that I buy a patch kit, since doing so is much cheaper than replacing the entire tube. A patch kit was very easy to use as the instructions were very details. First I added glue to the area and then put the patch on top. After holding the patch in place for a few minutes, I added a little talc. I also added a little talc to the inside of a flat bicycle tire. Once everything was set, I put the wheel back on the bike and everything was good as new.</text>

The wall my friend Jose wanted to paint is very tall, and his wife wanted to paint his living room wall red. His wife call this an accent wall because this an accent wall accents the room. Only one of the walls will be red, and then the others are white like normal. His living room wall is the accent wall. So, my friend Jose and my started by putting a drop cloth on the floor, so we would not spill any paint on the carpet. Next, we used tape to cover the edges of the wall doors and molding, so any paint would not cover those spots. Then we pulled out the paint cans, and the paint rollers, and started to paint his living room wall. His living room wall was so red! We had a lot of fun making sure that his living room wall was covered. We had to use even strokes, when we covered his living room wall with paint. His living room wall came out great!</text>

    <text>It has been six months since I got I hair cut. I usually get It cut really short and let It grow out to be shaggy. I usually just go to whichever local salon is closest, and I do n't have a regular person who usually cuts my hair. I only like to spend about $15 each time I go. Today, I decided get a faded haircut. The nearest place only charges $10, so I was pleased with The nearest place. The lady who helped I was named Sarah, and she talked a lot about the weather and how much she wanted to be outside. She also asked I a lot about my job, and my job turns out she husband also works where I work. A faded haircut took about 15 minutes and she did a pretty good job. A faded haircut's just the right length and she cut the back of my hair the way I like most. I paid she $10 and tipped she $5. I left completely satisfied.</text>

    <text>Just the other day, I thought about how boring my living room looked. I figured out that buying a painting would help to make a painting look a bit more lively. Thinking about what type of painting I wanted, I went to the closest home goods store to see what paintings they had available. It took some time, but I eventually picked out a painting that I liked more than the other ones there, along with some wall hangers. After bringing the painting home, I picked out a spot for the painting home on I living room wall that I liked. I then used a hammer to put some wall hangers into place. Once I made sure that some wall hangers were perfectly lined up, I hung up a painting and stepped back to get a better look at a painting. A painting looked perfect, and I was incredibly happy. After this, every time someone steps into my living room, they feel my living room much more lively than before.</text>
